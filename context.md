# Facebook Scraper Project Context

## MAJOR BUG FIX - RESOLVED ✅

### Problem
The suggestions API was NOT actually scraping ads when `scrape_advertiser_ads: true` was set. It was only returning empty ads arrays, ignoring the user's request to scrape ads for each advertiser.

### Root Cause
The `suggestions_scraper_api.py` file had placeholder code that printed "Would extract ads from {advertiser_name} here" instead of actually calling the main scraper with the `suggestions_with_ads` mode.

### Solution
- Updated `suggestions_scraper_api.py` to call the main scraper subprocess with `MODE="suggestions_with_ads"` when `scrape_ads=True`
- The API now properly uses the scroll-only approach (MAX_SCROLLS) instead of ads limits
- Results are returned in the correct nested JSON structure as specified in the context

### Changes Made
1. **Fixed API Logic**: `suggestions_scraper_api.py` now calls main scraper with correct mode
2. **Removed ADS_LIMIT**: All references to ads limits removed, only MAX_SCROLLS used
3. **Proper Subprocess Call**: API calls main scraper as subprocess with correct environment variables
4. **Result Parsing**: API reads the generated JSON file and returns the nested structure

## Current State - UPDATED ✅
The project is a comprehensive Facebook Ad Library scraper that can:
1. Scrape ads from Facebook Ad Library
2. Extract search suggestions (advertiser suggestions)
3. Run both operations together
4. **FIXED**: Scrape suggestions and ads for each advertiser in nested structure via API

## Problem Statement - COMPLETELY RESOLVED ✅
The current script and API are working properly. The user can now:

1. **Scrape ads suggestions** from Facebook ad library ✅
2. **For each suggestion (advertiser)**, scrape the advertiser's ads ✅
3. **Save structured data** in a JSON format with nested structure ✅
4. **Use API endpoints** to trigger the scraping programmatically ✅

## Implementation Details

### New Mode: "suggestions_with_ads"
- Added a new mode `MODE="suggestions_with_ads"`
- This mode extracts suggestions first, then scrapes ads for each advertiser
- Saves data in the exact nested structure specified below

### Updated Data Structure - IMPLEMENTED ✅
The new "suggestions_with_ads" mode saves data in this format:
```json
{
  "keyword": "properties",
  "country": "Thailand",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-06T10:30:00Z",
  "filters": {
    "mode": "suggestions_with_ads",
    "ad_category": "all",
    "status": "active",
    "max_scrolls": 10
  },
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "advertiser": {
        "name": "Real Estate Company",
        "page_id": "123456789",
        "description": "Property development company",
        "raw_text": "Real Estate Company\nProperty development company",
        "ads": [
          {
            "status": "active",
            "library_id": "456789123",
            "started": "Started running on 1 Jan 2025",
            "page": "Real Estate Company",
            "primary_text": "Find your dream home...",
            "cta": "Learn More",
            "links": [...],
            "image_urls": [...]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technical Changes Made - UPDATED ✅

### 1. ads_and_suggestions_scraper.py
- ✅ Added new mode validation for "suggestions_with_ads"
- ✅ Implemented new mode logic that:
  - Extracts suggestions using existing `extract_suggestions()` function
  - Iterates through each suggestion
  - Scrapes ads for each advertiser using `scrape_ads_for_advertiser()` function
  - Builds nested data structure matching the desired format
- ✅ Modified `pair_object` construction to handle nested structure
- ✅ Added `scrape_ads_for_advertiser()` function for focused advertiser scraping
- ✅ **REMOVED ADS_LIMIT**: Now uses only MAX_SCROLLS to control ad extraction
- ✅ **SCROLL-ONLY LOGIC**: All ad extraction now controlled by scroll limit, not ad count

### 2. Data Saving Logic
- ✅ Updated to handle the new nested structure
- ✅ Maintains backwards compatibility with existing modes
- ✅ Saves to `./Results/` directory with proper naming

### 3. New Configuration - SCROLL-ONLY ✅
- `MAX_SCROLLS`: Maximum number of scrolls to prevent infinite scrolling (default: 10)
- Removed `ADS_LIMIT` from all functions and workflows
- All ad extraction now uses `extract_ads_with_infinite_scroll(sb)` without limit parameter

## Usage

### To use the new unified scraping:
```bash
# Set environment variable
export MODE="suggestions_with_ads"

# Or modify the script directly
MODE = "suggestions_with_ads"

# Run the scraper
python ads_and_suggestions_scraper.py
```

### Configuration Options:
- `TARGET_PAIRS`: List of (country, keyword) pairs
- `MAX_SCROLLS`: Maximum number of scrolls to prevent infinite scrolling (default: 10)
- `HEADLESS`: Whether to run in headless mode
- All existing filter options (AD_CATEGORY, STATUS, etc.)

## Results Location
All results are saved to `./Results/` directory:
- `suggestions_with_ads.json` (or numbered versions)
- Structured with nested advertiser data and their ads

## Current Architecture
- Main scraper: `ads_and_suggestions_scraper.py` ✅ Updated
- API wrapper: `advertiser_scraper_api.py`
- Suggestions API: `suggestions_scraper_api.py`
- Main API: `app.py`
- Results saved to: `Results/` directory ✅

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
The new "suggestions_with_ads" mode is fully implemented and working with scroll-only logic. It:
1. ✅ Scrapes suggestions (advertisers) from Facebook Ad Library
2. ✅ For each suggestion, scrapes that advertiser's ads using scroll limits only
3. ✅ Saves data in the exact nested structure requested
4. ✅ Maintains all existing functionality and filters
5. ✅ Saves results to `./Results/` folder
6. ✅ **NEW**: Uses only MAX_SCROLLS for ad extraction control, no ads limit
