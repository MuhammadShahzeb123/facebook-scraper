        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:10",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:10",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:10",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:10",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:14",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:14",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:14",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:14",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:14",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:14",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:14",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:14",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:14",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:14",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:05",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:05",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:05",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:05",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:05",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:05",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:05",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:05",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:05",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:05",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:05",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:16",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:16",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:16",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:18",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:18",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:18",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:18",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:14",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:14",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:16",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:16",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:16",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:16",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:16",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:16",

        "primary_text": "At 53, I was completely overwhelmed by contradictory advice about what to eat for my liver health.\n\n\"No red meat.\"\n\"Avoid all fruit because of the sugar.\"\n\"Cut out all fats.\"\n\"Go keto.\"\n\"Try intermittent fasting.\"\n\nEvery source had a different opinion, and my own doctor just vaguely said to \"eat healthier\" without specific guidance.\n\nMeanwhile, my liver enzymes kept climbing, and I felt worse by the day â exhausted, bloated, and increasingly worried about my health.\n\nThe breaking point came when I joined a liver health support group and saw people arguing fiercely about whether red meat was beneficial or harmful for liver health.\n\nSome cited studies showing potential inflammatory effects, while others pointed to research about the benefits of certain amino acids found in lean meats.\n\nWho was right? And more importantly â what was I supposed to actually EAT to help my struggling liver?\n\nThis constant contradiction wasn't just frustrating â it was paralyzing. I'd try one approach for a week, then read something that made me doubt it and switch to something else.\n\nThe worst part? Every time I'd get a blood test, my liver enzymes were still elevated:\n\nâ¢ ALT hovering around 95 (normal is under 55)\nâ¢ AST at 78 (normal is under 48)\nâ¢ GGT at 112 (normal is under 61)\n\nThrough research, I discovered something important: while dietary approaches vary, certain nutrients consistently support liver health regardless of your specific diet.\n\nCompounds like silymarin from milk thistle, antioxidants from dandelion root, and anti-inflammatory components in turmeric have been studied for their liver-supporting properties.\n\nThat's when I found AlphaCleanse â a comprehensive formula with 12 liver-supporting ingredients designed to provide targeted nutritional support regardless of dietary approach.\n\nI decided to give AlphaCleanse a try â just 2 capsules daily with breakfast.\n\nWeek 1-2: The first change I noticed was improved digestion. The bloating that had become my constant companion started to diminish, even when I ate foods that typically bothered me.\n\nWeek 3-4: By the end of the first month, I noticed my clothes fitting a bit looser, especially around my waist. The brain fog that had plagued me started to lift.\n\nMonth 2: My sleep improved dramatically, and I woke feeling refreshed. My skin looked clearer, and friends commented that I seemed more energetic.\n\nMonth 3: At my three-month check-up, I was nervous but hopeful as I waited for my liver enzyme results.\n\nWhen my results came back, I was thrilled to see improvement:\n\nALT down to 42 (from 95)\nAST down to 39 (from 78)\nGGT down to 57 (from 112)\n\nSix months later, I've maintained normal liver enzymes and lost 31 pounds without following any extreme diet. Here's what I've learned works for ME:\n\nâ¢ I enjoy high-quality protein in moderate portions\n\nâ¢ I eat fruit daily, focusing on berries and other lower-sugar options\n\nâ¢ I've increased my vegetable intake naturally because I actually crave them now\n\nI'm not the only one who found clarity through AlphaCleanse:\n\n\"I was driving myself crazy trying to follow the 'perfect' liver diet. With AlphaCleanse, I found I could eat a balanced diet with moderate amounts of everything and still see my liver enzymes improve.\" â­â­â­â­â­ - Catherine R., 49\n\n\"The fruit debate was driving me crazy â some experts said avoid all fruit while others recommended it. With AlphaCleanse supporting my liver, I can enjoy moderate amounts of fruit without worry.\" â­â­â­â­â­ - Jennifer K., 47\n\nAlphaCleanse contains ingredients backed by research:\n\nâ¢ Milk Thistle: Contains silymarin, studied for liver-protective properties\n\nâ¢ Dandelion Root: Rich in antioxidants that support liver function\n\nâ¢ Turmeric: Contains curcumin, researched for its anti-inflammatory properties\n\nâ¢ Schisandra Berry: Standardized for optimal liver-supporting properties\n\nð Made in the USA in an FDA-registered facility\nð Formulated with premium organic ingredients\nð Gentle & safe for daily use\nð± Vegan, gluten-free, and non-GMO\nâ Backed by our 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee\n\nDon't let diet confusion stand in the way of your liver health. AlphaCleanse provides targeted support while you find a sustainable approach to eating.",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:12",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:12",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:12",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:12",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:12",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:12",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:19",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:06",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:18",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:18",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:18",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:18",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:18",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:18",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:13",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:17",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:13",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:13",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:16",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:13",
