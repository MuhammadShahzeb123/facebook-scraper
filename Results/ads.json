        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:12",

        "primary_text": "\"He finally remembered the woman waiting for him at home, only to face her divorce papers. Confident she'd regret it, he signed. But post-divorce, she blossomed, turning heads everywhere. Defeated, he begged to win her back!\n=====\nIn the bustling, weathered heart of Orkset, flames erupted violently within an ancient apartment building. Propelled by gusts of wind, the fire devoured the structure, belching dense smoke and bright, searing tongues of flame.\n\n\"Saved! They've been saved.\" The words echoed amidst the chaos.\n\nFirefighters emerged from the smoldering inferno, carrying Carrie Campbell to safety at the roadside.\n\nHer features, usually refined and expressive, were now smeared with soot; her sparkling eyes dimmed to a vacant gaze, hollow and lost.\n\nAs reality seeped back into her consciousness, Carrie felt a rush of gratitude overpower her usual composure. Her voice, hoarse and weak, conveyed a profound \"thank you\" to her rescuers. Shaking, she fumbled for her phone, her fingertips quivering as they found the familiar number.\n\n\"Hello, the person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe automated message played after a few rings, leaving her with a lump in her throat, her unvoiced frustrations and sorrow welling up inside her.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a deafening roar, the explosion abruptly silenced the cold, mechanical voice echoing through the line. Carrie's head snapped upwards, shock painted on her face as she witnessed the apartment she had just exited erupt into flames.\n\nChunks of debris were hurled into the air by the force of the blast, scattering across the sky.\n\nPanic engulfed the crowd as survivors, freshly rescued, screamed in terror. They huddled together, seeking solace in each other's arms, their cries piercing the tumultuous scene. In stark contrast, Carrie lay alone on a stretcher, her isolation magnified amidst the chaos.\n\n\"Kristopher...\" Fighting the dread creeping up her spine, Carrie pressed her lips together tightly and dialed her husband's number again, her resolve unwavering.\n\nYet, the call disconnected after a few short rings, leaving her with a haunting silence.\n\nJust then, a Twitter notification flickered on her phone screen.\n\nThe gossip feed was alive with the latest gossip: #LiseNash #MysteriouBoyfriend.\n\nAccording to the tweet, a producer from a well-known variety show had invited the renowned star Lise Nash to a dinner, which had quickly soured when she declined to partake in a toast.\n\nThis act of defiance had sparked a confrontation, only to be interrupted by Lise's domineering boyfriend. He stormed into the private dining room, dismissing the producer with a dismissive wave and escorting Lise away.\n\nThe tweet described the scene vividly, painting a picture of a powerful man defending his beloved partner.\n\nYet, perhaps due to his prominence, only the back of the man was visible in the accompanying photos, preserving his anonymity. Meanwhile, Lise, donning an oversized suit jacket, beamed a smile, reaching out to clasp his hand as they departed together.\n\nCarrie's eyes were glued to the screen, her stare intense and unblinking as she absorbed the image before her.\n\nThere he was--Kristopher Norris!\n\nThe suit jacket draped carelessly over Lise was a dead giveaway.\n\nEvery piece of clothing Kristopher owned had been meticulously tailored by a master craftsman abroad, a detail Carrie knew all too well.\n\nHer grip on her phone tightened, her knuckles blanching to a stark white, as if her very soul were being squeezed by an invisible hand, the pain sharp and acid-like in its intensity.\n\nIn her most desperate moment, Kristopher had coldly disconnected their call, choosing instead to be at Lise's side.\n\nWhat was the worth of their two-year marriage?\n\nThe tears she had been holding back now overwhelmed her, streaming down her face.\n\nEven as she tilted her head back in a futile attempt to stem the flow, the tears continued to escape.\n\nLise had always been Kristopher's first love, a fact whispered and gossiped about among their circles. The Norris family had never approved of Lise, seeing her ordinary background as unfitting.\n\nForced apart by family pressures, it had been Lise who ended things, but the past, it seemed, was not easily left behind.\n\nKristopher had diligently pursued the leadership of the Norris family, harboring dreams of finally being with Lise.\n\nYet, when he reached his goal, he discovered that Lise had already chosen another.\n\nIn defiance of his family's expectations and perhaps out of bitterness, Kristopher turned to Carrie, a woman equally devoid of wealth or status, to become Mrs. Norris, thereby blocking any matchmaking attempts by his relatives.\n\nAt that time, Carrie faced immense pressure from her father, Tristan Campbell, who was pushing her towards a marriage with a playboy, the son of a business associate, to cover her grandmother's steep medical expenses.\n\nBoth Kristopher and Carrie, driven by their personal motives, consented to a marriage of convenience.\n\nOriginally set for just one year, their contractual marriage stretched beyond its term, sustained by a shared understanding between them.\n\nOver time, Carrie began to believe in the authenticity of their union, never suspecting that it was merely an extension of her hopes.\n\nJust moments ago, a fire had nearly claimed Carrie's life. In that critical moment, she reached out to Kristopher, only to be twice rebuffed as he spent his time with Lise.\n\nThis harsh reality shattered Carrie's illusions, revealing that her perceived transition from pretense to genuine relationship was nothing but a facade maintained by her own desires.\n\nCarrie wasn't even a temporary substitute in Kristopher's life but merely a pawn used to spite his family.\n\nAfter a poignant pause, tears welled up in Carrie's eyes, unstoppable and poignant.\n\nIt might be time for her to release herself from the shackles of her own hopeful delusions--to stop deceiving herself.\n\nChapter 2 Trending Topics\nThe overwhelming number of injuries from the fire was staggering, straining the already frantic doctors and nurses as they tried to provide aid.\n\nCarrie had been merely grazed by a splintered clothes rack, which left a deep, jagged wound on her calf. In comparison to the chaos around her, her wounds seemed almost negligible.\n\nShe managed to get basic care--a brisk cleaning and a quick wrap of bandages--at a local hospital before catching a cab back to her house.\n\nBayview Villa, a grand property under Kristopher's name, was technically their matrimonial residence.\n\nLiving alone had become the norm for Carrie, as Kristopher was hardly ever around. She had bid farewell to the housekeeper, discovering that her life could be quite adequately maintained with just takeout, deliveries, and the occasional visit from a part-time cleaner.\n\nNow, she found herself the sole occupant of the sprawling living room, sinking into the sofa, her gaze drifting across the empty space.\n\nThe stark, monochrome decor did nothing to imbue warmth into the atmosphere.\n\nA chilling realization crept up on her: this vast, elegant space felt more like a colossal tomb, a silent grave for her lost years of youth and a love that had quietly slipped away.\n\nIn this cold, echoing house, would anyone even notice if her breath ceased one day?\n\nCarrie exhaled a weary sigh, her frame heavy as she leaned against the cold wall for support, struggling up the stairs to her bedroom on the second floor.\n\nEach step was a battle, sending stabbing pains shooting through her from the surface of her skin down to her aching bones.\n\nThe house, stark and hollow, echoed even the smallest sounds, magnifying her sense of isolation.\n\nIt was today, amidst this profound silence, that Carrie truly grasped the all-encompassing nature of her loneliness--it was almost tangible, enveloping her senses with its texture and mournful whispers, tightening around her heart like a vice, producing a dull, relentless ache.\n\nUpon reaching the sanctuary of her bedroom, she collapsed onto the bed, the very embodiment of exhaustion, feeling it both physically and spiritually.\n\nJust as she surrendered to this weariness, the sharp ring of the phone pierced the silence.\n\n\"You reached out to me earlier. What do you need?\" Kristopher's voice cut through the line, cold and distant as ever.\n\nCarrie was caught off guard by his unexpected call. Words failed her as she parted her lips to respond, but before she could collect her thoughts, a soft, feminine voice floated through from the other end. \"Kristopher, will you join me to...\"\n\nA surge of emotions tightened Carrie's grip on the phone, her heart thumping louder with each second. Overwhelmed and unable to contain her rising panic, she demanded, \"Who's there with you?\"\n\nKristopher gave no answer, merely stating in a flat, disinterested voice, \"If there's something you need, let's catch up when I'm back. I have pressing engagements right now, so I must disconnect.\"\n\nHe promptly ended the call, cutting off any chance for Carrie to reply.\n\nAs the harsh beep of the disconnected line filled her ears, Carrie's lips twisted into a rueful grin. How utterly foolish she felt! Deep down, she knew his response all too well, yet she had clung to the hope of hearing his voice confirm it.\n\nWith a sense of self-inflicted irony, Carrie activated her tablet and scrolled through the day's hot topics.\n\nOne headline caught her eye: \"A female star shielded from harassment at a dinner by her formidable partner.\" A wry smile twisted her lips.\n\nCarrie knew all too well what it was like to face harassment at those kinds of dinners.\n\nShe vividly remembered her first major audition after her entering the showbiz; her agent had escorted her to a dinner with the influential director and producer of the drama series \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nAs a novice in the dizzying world of showbiz, Carrie had felt incredibly vulnerable, uncertain of how to navigate the murky waters of such gatherings.\n\nThe producer had eyed her shamelessly, sneering as he asked, \"Is this the new talent you're introducing? She appears presentable, but I'm curious to see how she fares with a drink. Here's the deal, if you can gulp down this bottle in one go, I'll secure you an audition for the lead role.\"\n\nCarrie was inclined to decline, but under the relentless pressure from her agent, she found herself compelled to consume the entire bottle.\n\nAs the evening wore on, she was hurriedly taken to the hospital suffering from a severe stomach ailment.\n\nHer agent, fretful about the prospect of the role slipping away to another, quickly settled the hospital charges and departed.\n\nAt that time, Carrie found herself isolated in a hospital bed for several long days.\n\nYet, even before Carrie could be released from the hospital, the media was abuzz with the announcement that Lise had secured the lead role in \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nSubsequently, her agent rebuked Carrie for her lack of ambition, complaining, \"You are more appealing than Lise, so why can't you show more drive? She cozied up to Mr. Norris and hardly had to make an effort. She's surrounded by people eager to cater to her every need. I've heard that Mr. Norris personally orchestrated her landing the lead role in this production!\"\n\nWhen the show premiered, Lise was catapulted into stardom, swiftly ascending to the elite echelons of the acting world.\n\nFrom that moment forward, Carrie let her acting aspirations wane and chose instead to devote herself entirely to supporting her husband, Kristopher.\n\nAfter all, no matter her efforts, she could never get the same career opportunities that Lise seemed to receive effortlessly with Kristopher's offhand remarks.\n\nAt that time, Carrie had believed she was filling the role that was meant to be Lise's as Mrs. Norris, which meant she owed Lise.\n\nBy giving up the career opportunities to Lise, Carrie thought they would settle their unspoken debt.\n\nHowever, Carrie hadn't foreseen that Lise would claim both the coveted career and Kristopher's affections.\n\nAs Lise's professional and love life blossomed, Carrie came to the painful realization that she had been overly consumed with her romantic pursuits, at the expense of her career, and now, she found herself bereft of both love and professional fulfillment.\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Carrie viewed her past two years as tragically misguided.\n\nGiven another opportunity, she resolved she wouldn't be so unguarded, letting her heart recklessly fall captive to Kristopher's charm.\n\n\"Ms. Spencer, the new copyright contract is prepared. Please review it for any discrepancies.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed with the alert, snapping Carrie out of her reverie. She gazed at the PDF file attached in the message, her mind briefly overwhelmed.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Katrina Spencer, Carrie had once made a name for herself as a budding screenwriter, selling numerous scripts in her early days.\n\nDuring her early career as Katrina, Carrie often sold her work for a pittance, compelled by her urgent need for immediate cash.\n\nOver the years, these scripts transformed into blockbuster films and hit series, catapulting Katrina's reputation to new heights.\n\nBy this time, Carrie had married Kristopher and was no longer plagued by the financial woes that had once driven her to desperation--her grandmother's hefty medical bills were a thing of the past. With her financial crises resolved, Carrie's life had pivoted to domestic responsibilities, striving to be an exemplary wife to Kristopher. Amidst these changes, her pseudonym, Katrina Spencer, gradually receded into the background.\n\nHowever, her past as Katrina wasn't ready to be shelved just yet. Recently, an interested buyer had come forward, ready to pay a handsome sum for one of her old scripts.\n\nCarrie, however, was hesitant to sell. She raised several concerns about the contract presented to her, and to her astonishment, the buyer was genuine enough to revise it accordingly.\n\nHolding the revised contract in her hands, Carrie inhaled deeply, her resolve hardening. She seemed to have reached a crucial decision.\n\nHer fingers danced over her phone's keyboard with swift precision, typing out a firm command. \"Create a divorce agreement following my terms and ensure it reaches Kristopher Norris at the Norris Group.\"\n\nWithout pausing for a response, she placed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step echoing a blend of determination and newfound independence.\n\nChapter 3 Exchange Of Conveniences\nThirty minutes had passed, Carrie finally heaved herself up from the bathtub, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. As she lifted her gaze, her own image in the mirror halted her movements--her skin appeared as smooth and impeccable as fine porcelain, glowing with an unblemished radiance.\n\nHer eyes, deep pools of allure, sparkled with an enchanting, soft warmth, inviting anyone who dared meet her gaze.\n\nDespite edging into her late twenties at twenty-five, she reveled in the fact that time had yet to etch its marks upon her flawless complexion.\n\nSurely, a woman with such a visage had no place for self-pity.\n\nAbsorbed in her contemplation, Carrie carelessly extended her right leg onto the cold floor, forgetting it was the very limb she had injured. Wrapped excessively in cling film to shield it from moisture, the tight encasement had stifled her circulation, rendering her leg eerily numb. As her foot touched down, it betrayed her, slipping forward unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Carrie gasped, her arms flailing in a frantic ballet, searching for a lifeline in the void.\n\nJust as she teetered on the brink of a painful rendezvous with the floor, the bathroom door burst open.\n\nKristopher stood at the entrance, his suit immaculately tailored, creating a striking figure. As their eyes locked, he paused, visibly taken aback, then quickly closed the distance with brisk strides.\n\nCarrie's breath caught as Kristopher swept her up in a graceful bridal style, an unexpected tightness wrapping around her waist. Caught off guard by his sudden appearance, Carrie realized with a jolt that she was completely bare. A flush of embarrassment washed over her as she instinctively clutched her hands over her chest.\n\nThis was their first moment of such intimacy since their wedding, and the discomfort made her toes curl inward, her skin blushing a delicate shade of pink.\n\nKristopher looked down at her with a mischievous grin. \"Let's be honest, there's not much to see,\" he teased gently.\n\nFeeling both mortified and slightly irritated, Carrie snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Norris, after all you've seen, I suppose nothing can impress you anymore.\"\n\nShe carried her C-cup curves with understated charm, a touch of sensuality that outshone Lise's painfully flat, almost awkwardly rigid build.\n\nYet Carrie knew well that without love, even the most perfect physique paled in comparison to the charm of one dearly cherished.\n\nNonchalantly, Kristopher reached for a bathrobe hanging behind the door and draped it over her. His frown deepened at her comment. \"What are you talking about, Carrie?\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike him, and his expression grew even more impatient. \"Tell me, did you send those divorce papers in the dead of night just to lure me back here--to catch you completely bare?\" His tone was a mix of disbelief and annoyance. \"I told you I was swamped with work. Was this dramatic display really necessary?\"\n\nCarrie's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the tension between them. He was always so quick to lose patience with her.\n\nShe wasn't the type to throw around words like divorce or breakups lightly. In fact, this was the first time she'd ever mentioned divorce in their two-year marriage, yet he seemed indifferent to her turmoil. He simply dismissed her concerns as if she were overreacting about trivial matters.\n\nDespite the throbbing pain in her leg, Carrie mustered her strength and said, \"Put me down.\"\n\nKristopher, however, paid no heed, his eyes scanning her leg swathed in bandages. His brow furrowed slightly. \"What happened to your leg? Is this some elaborate ploy to lure me back?\"\n\nAt his words, a bitter laugh escaped Carrie.\n\nIt seemed he viewed her as merely seeking attention, and in failing to capture it, she had likely concocted a story to draw him back, allowing her to dramatize her plight in his presence.\n\nWith a blank face, she replied untruthfully, \"It's a beauty treatment that shouldn't get wet.\"\n\n\"Why did you suddenly decide to undergo such a treatment?\" Kristopher inquired, his tone casual as he carried her outside, not pressing the issue further.\n\nHis frame was large, and through his thin shirt, she could distinctly feel the warmth of his body and the defined shape of his chest muscles.\n\nThe closeness created an uncomfortable tension for Carrie, who had resolved to end things once and for all.\n\nHer voice climbed involuntarily, sharper this time. \"Oh, since when have you been concerned with such minor things, Mr. Norris?\"\n\nFor the first time, Kristopher witnessed her using biting sarcasm; it struck him as peculiarly amusing. With a calm demeanor, he responded, \"You're my wife, it's only natural I'd be concerned about your well-being.\"\n\n\"Really?\" There was a somber note in Carrie's voice now. \"It seems like you've never really regarded me as your wife. I'm scared that if I were to die, you wouldn't even know until much later.\"\n\nAfter all, at that very moment, Kristopher had been distracted, lost in moments with his first love, too consumed to lend an ear to her desperate pleas.\n\nCaught off guard by her accusation, Kristopher's eyes widened with surprise before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. \"Carrie, what's brought on this sudden outburst of anger? Just because I was tied up this afternoon and missed your call? Perhaps I've been too indulgent with you lately, and it's made you a bit too presumptuous?\"\n\nCarrie froze, startled. Was he accusing her of being too presumptuous?\n\nShe realized their marriage had always been lopsided. In his eyes, she was nothing more than a transactional partner, a woman who had bartered her freedom for financial security.\n\nTheir union was meant to be a mere exchange of conveniences, yet she had, quite foolishly, fallen deeply in love with him.\n\nIn the tricky terrain of romance, the one who fell first invariably found themselves at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nKristopher's dismissive reaction left Carrie reeling, her emotions dismissed as trifles, a tight knot of suffocation rising in her chest.\n\n\"I said to put me down this instant!\" Carrie exclaimed, jerking her head to the side, her voice laced with a sharp edge of impatience.\n\nKristopher remained mute, effortlessly carrying her towards the bed before suddenly releasing his hold.\n\nCarrie felt a jolt as the support vanished, her heart skipping a beat as she instinctively grasped for him.\n\nTheir bodies collided on the bed, her bathrobe teetering on the brink of decency, threatening to unravel with any minor shift.\n\nPropped on one elbow, Kristopher gazed down at her, his lips curled into a sly, teasing grin. \"You wanted to be let go, didn't you? So why cling to me now?\"\n\nHis eyes, deep and sparkling like a midnight lake speckled with stars, captivated her.\n\nIn those celestial depths, Carrie caught a glimpse of her own reflection.\n\nAt times like this, she was misled into believing he harbored a deep affection.\n\nSadly, his heart was a fortress reserved for Lise, and all Carrie had left were empty fantasies.\n\n\"Boring!\" she exclaimed, her voice devoid of any enthusiasm as she attempted to rise, her hand inadvertently brushing against something unexpected.\n\nThe following moment brought a noticeable shift in his cock pressing against her stomach.\n\n\"Don't move, or I can't promise what might happen next,\" he warned in a deep, gravelly voice.\n\nWith a frown, Carrie internally cursed upon hearing the statement.\n\nIt was an undeniable fact. Primal instincts steered the actions of men. Absence of affection didn't quell their basic desires.\n\nYet, she dared not agitate Kristopher. Angling her face away, her body remained rigid, frozen in place.\n\nCarrie, feeling irked, shot back. \"Didn't you say there's nothing here to see? What's with the reaction now, Mr. Norris? Are you really that easy to impress?\"\n\nNo sooner had her words flown than she grasped the potential repercussions of her sharp tongue.\n\nA wave of regret surged through Carrie, but instead of anger, Kristopher responded with a chuckle, \"You are my wife, after all. Since that's something I can't alter, I might as well embrace it. Besides, it's been years since we became husband and wife--it would be a shame to neglect you completely.\"\n\nChapter 4 Are You Out Of Your Mind?\nKristopher slipped his hand beneath the folds of her bathrobe, his touch tracing the curve of Carrie's skin, as smooth and delicate as silk. He encircled her slender waist, drawing her closer with a gentle yet firm grip.\n\nHer face, a captivating canvas of defiance and visible irritation, ignited in him an uncontrollable urge to claim victory over her resistance.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy, yet he remained composed, slowly removing his tailored suit.\n\nThe fabric of his suit brushed lightly against Carrie's cheek, releasing a mix of scents: a familiar woody aroma intertwined with an unexpected zesty twist of lemon. It was unmistakably Jo Malone's Blue Agava and Cacao--Lise's signature scent.\n\nA surge of nausea overwhelmed Carrie at the realization.\n\nAs Kristopher's eyes, now shaded with a stormy intensity, drew nearer to hers, the proximity conjured unwelcome visions of him with Lise. Her stomach churned violently, and with a sudden movement, she pushed him away, propping herself up with a jolt and a dry retch.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer stomach had been empty all day, leaving her with nothing to bring up.\n\nThe desire in Kristopher's gaze flickered out, replaced by a cold, detached expression as he withdrew slightly.\n\nObserving the genuine distress and the reddening of Carrie's eyes, Kristopher perceived her reaction for outright disgust at their closeness.\n\nHe paused, fingers adjusting his shirt cuffs, his voice cold as he confronted her. \"Carrie, is this reaction reserved only for me, or is it how you respond to all men?\"\n\nThe air in the room turned frosty, thick with tension.\n\nCarrie swallowed the sharp sting in her throat, her eyes widening in shock as she stared up at him.\n\nEver since their marriage, she had cut ties with nearly all her male friends, yet here was Kristopher, casually tossing out comments sharp enough to cut glass.\n\nThe years of love she had poured into their relationship now seemed utterly futile.\n\nHeat crept up her neck, coloring her cheeks a bright scarlet as indignation took hold. Without thinking, her hand flew up and delivered a stinging slap across Kristopher's face.\n\nAll her suppressed grievances from the day ignited in that swift motion.\n\nHer bathrobe, loosened in the heat of the moment, slipped from her shoulders. Ignoring the flush of exposure, she swiftly gathered the fabric and draped it around herself, her movements quick and firm.\n\nThe impact of her slap had left a light, crimson mark on Kristopher's cheek, marking him with her outrage.\n\nHis eyes, wide with disbelief, met hers. \"Carrie, are you out of your mind?\"\n\nOut of her mind? Yes, she was clearly insane to ever fall for him in the first place.\n\nCarrie fumed silently, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nSuddenly, the sharp buzz of the phone on the table cut through the mounting tension, its vibration bringing a brief respite from their standoff.\n\nKristopher cast a fleeting glance at the message, shut off the phone with a snap, and strode towards the door, his back rigid with tension.\n\nHer voice, firm and unwavering, chased after him. \"We're getting a divorce! Make sure you sign those papers before you walk out that door!\"\n\nKristopher paused briefly and said sharply, \"I have something to do now. When I return, do whatever pleases you.\" With that, he forcefully shut the door.\n\nCarrie's eyes followed his unwavering exit, feeling an oppressive weight compressing her chest once again.\n\nShe disregarded the sharp sting in her leg and hobbled determinedly toward her tablet. Fingers trembling, she hastily navigated to Lise's Twitter page.\n\nLise had just uploaded a new tweet.\n\nThe photo showed her lying down with a fever patch adhered to her forehead, still enveloped in Kristopher's familiar jacket.\n\nThe caption read, \"Being sick makes me extra clingy. Wishing I had someone here. Stay cozy and take care, everyone!\"\n\nThe simultaneous timing of these two events made it almost impossible for Carrie not to suspect that Kristopher had dashed off to tend to Lise.\n\nCarrie's instincts loudly proclaimed that this was no accident; Lise had deliberately sought to tug at Kristopher's heartstrings. It appeared her tactics were effective.\n\nNot even Carrie's stark threat of divorce could overshadow Lise's theatrical display of vulnerability.\n\nSeething with fury, Carrie quaked like a leaf swept into a storm.\n\nShe steeled herself against the heartache, forcefully ripping the plastic wrap from her aching leg.\n\nAfter her lengthy soak, the bath's lingering moisture had infiltrated her skin, inflaming the wound until it was a vivid, angry red and painfully swollen.\n\nShe, too, could be clingy. Even in the harshest times back in the county, she had shown vulnerability, breaking down into soft sobs within the comforting arms of her grandmother, especially that one time she got burned by the scalding kettle.\n\nBut such vulnerability had its time and place, and it wasn't now.\n\nThe stark reality of Kristopher's exit forced Carrie to confront her need for self-reliance.\n\nBiting down hard on her lip, Carrie cleaned the throbbing wound with a practiced hand before securely wrapping it anew.\n\nShe rose with a newfound resolve and yanked a black suitcase from the far end of her expansive walk-in closet--it held all the belongings she'd brought into this house as a hopeful bride.\n\nShe grabbed a fresh set of clothes to slip into and left a bank card neatly on the bedside table.\n\nShe had transferred every penny she'd earned over the past year onto that card, effectively settling her financial entanglements with Kristopher over the last two years and cutting him out of her life for good.\n\nDragging the heavy suitcase behind her, she limped painfully out of the opulent villa.\n\nAs she passed through the gate, she wrapped her baseball jacket more tightly around her slight figure, her silhouette hauntingly solitary in the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe night air of early spring was bitingly cold, devoid of any trace of warmth, a chill that seemed almost faint compared to the ice forming in Carrie's shattered heart.\n\nShe had arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a heart full of dreams, and now she was leaving, dreams crumbled, utterly alone.\n\nA bitter laugh slipped through her lips. If only she hadn't fallen so hard for him, if only she'd proposed an amicable separation at the end of their agreed year, maybe she wouldn't be wandering now, a lost soul in the shadow of her former self.\n\nLise didn't have to lift a finger, and Carrie had already fallen, utterly broken and beyond redemption.\n\nChapter 5 A Gathering\nMeanwhile, in the Oasis Club, renowned as the priciest spot in Orkset, the air within the VIP room crackled with excitement. Under the spell of bright lights and thumping music, a diverse group of men and women lounged together, basking in the exclusivity of the setting.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, revealing Kristopher in the doorway.\n\nThe karaoke session halted abruptly as the crowd turned to greet him in unison, voices mingling. \"Kristopher...\"\n\nBefore they could utter another word, a woman cloaked from head to toe stepped out from behind him.\n\nLise, with a fluid motion, removed her mask and slid her arm through Kristopher's. She addressed the room with a poised charm. \"My assistant took a sudden leave, and I found myself without company. Not keen on spending the evening alone, I invited Kristopher to join me. I trust that's alright?\"\n\nLise's beauty was without question. Her face was a delicate composition of cherry lips and a sculpted nose, framed by eyes that shimmered with a vulnerable allure, commanding a protective fervor from those around her--her presence, ethereal.\n\nIn contrast, Carrie's features were more pronounced, her beauty vivid and striking. Lise, by comparison, carried a softer, more understated elegance.\n\nYet, as it often goes, matters of the heart followed no simple paths.\n\nWhile Kristopher and Carrie were married, it was in name only; Kristopher seemed detached and seldom included her in private social events.\n\nThe group didn't have much of a relationship with Carrie, leading them to feel no obligation to defend her.\n\nUpon hearing Lise's comment, a moment of discomfort rippled through the air. Nonetheless, they quickly recovered, offering a congenial smile as they said, \"We're all friends here; let's not bother with formalities.\"\n\nLise offered a subtle, knowing smile, as she gracefully accompanied Kristopher into the bustling room.\n\nThe event that evening had been meticulously planned to express appreciation for Kristopher's contributions.\n\nAs they stepped into the room, the crowd parted like the sea, making way for them to proceed to the seats of honor.\n\nThe group's leader handed Kristopher a glass of wine with a flourish, proclaiming with a broad grin, \"We truly owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Norris! Your exceptional talents are the talk of the town, and witnessing them firsthand today only confirms it. Without your expertise, securing this contract would have been a fantasy!\"\n\nTheir gathering marked the launch of a novel shopping platform, one that had been in negotiation with numerous local brands in Orkset. But the scenario changed dramatically when the tech giant JoyBuy dramatically entered the scene, stirring up the competitive landscape.\n\nCompeting with JoyBuy was akin to the classic David versus Goliath tale--hopelessly daunting. In a surge of desperation, they turned to Kristopher, reaching out through a network of connections for his renowned strategic prowess.\n\nWith his characteristic swiftness, Kristopher hatched an ingenious plan and swiftly secured the deal, snatching it from the clutches of JoyBuy right before the business association could ink their agreement--a masterful coup that reverberated success.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround only intensified the already deep respect everyone held for Kristopher.\n\nAlbin Murray, beaming with pride, couldn't help but boast, \"Ah, just look at the caliber of his friends! They thought they could steal deals right under our noses, obviously underestimating Kristopher's clout!\"\n\nAlbin, born into the wealthy Murray family, counted himself among Kristopher's closest friends. He was renowned for his sprawling social web--a network through which the desperate plea for help was channeled to Kristopher.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristopher himself, the focus of all their discussions, reclined nonchalantly on the couch, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe was well-versed in the art of receiving compliments; thus, his expression stayed calm and detached.\n\nThe ambient light sculpted his angular features, casting dramatic shadows that emphasized his high nose bridge and sharply cut jawline, as though he were a living masterpiece.\n\nHis natural grace and detachment eclipsed any terrestrial magnificence.\n\nFollowing a sequence of celebratory toasts, when it became apparent that Kristopher merely touched his glass without truly drinking, the rest of the company toned down their conversation, allowing him a moment of repose with his eyes gently shut.\n\nLise, slightly feverish, opted not to indulge in the spirits, choosing instead to sit in serene silence next to Kristopher, her eyes lingering on him with a look of deep, unmistakable adoration.\n\nAlbin, captivated by the seemingly perfect pair, pondered the whims of destiny. He discreetly captured their image with his smartphone and nonchalantly shared it across his social networks.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the liquor dwindled, the room's door swung open anew.\n\nKristopher's personal assistant, Oliver Brooks, made his entrance, acknowledging the gathering with a courteous nod that bordered on respect but avoided groveling, swiftly positioning himself in front of Kristopher.\n\nSilence hung in the air, yet Lise, unable to contain her curiosity, leaned in and whispered, \"What's going on?\"\n\nOliver, maintaining his focus on Kristopher, chose not to respond directly to her.\n\nA flush of embarrassment tinted Lise's cheeks as she turned towards Kristopher, hesitatingly inquiring, \"Should I leave?\"\n\nKristopher adjusted his posture, his voice low and calm as he instructed, \"Go ahead, speak.\"\n\nA shiver of apprehension coursed through Oliver as he tentatively began, \"Mr. Norris, Mrs. Norris has departed from Bayview Villa, and...\"\n\n&9&\n0:00 / 5:56",

        "primary_text": "\"He finally remembered the woman waiting for him at home, only to face her divorce papers. Confident she'd regret it, he signed. But post-divorce, she blossomed, turning heads everywhere. Defeated, he begged to win her back!\n=====\nIn the bustling, weathered heart of Orkset, flames erupted violently within an ancient apartment building. Propelled by gusts of wind, the fire devoured the structure, belching dense smoke and bright, searing tongues of flame.\n\n\"Saved! They've been saved.\" The words echoed amidst the chaos.\n\nFirefighters emerged from the smoldering inferno, carrying Carrie Campbell to safety at the roadside.\n\nHer features, usually refined and expressive, were now smeared with soot; her sparkling eyes dimmed to a vacant gaze, hollow and lost.\n\nAs reality seeped back into her consciousness, Carrie felt a rush of gratitude overpower her usual composure. Her voice, hoarse and weak, conveyed a profound \"thank you\" to her rescuers. Shaking, she fumbled for her phone, her fingertips quivering as they found the familiar number.\n\n\"Hello, the person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe automated message played after a few rings, leaving her with a lump in her throat, her unvoiced frustrations and sorrow welling up inside her.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a deafening roar, the explosion abruptly silenced the cold, mechanical voice echoing through the line. Carrie's head snapped upwards, shock painted on her face as she witnessed the apartment she had just exited erupt into flames.\n\nChunks of debris were hurled into the air by the force of the blast, scattering across the sky.\n\nPanic engulfed the crowd as survivors, freshly rescued, screamed in terror. They huddled together, seeking solace in each other's arms, their cries piercing the tumultuous scene. In stark contrast, Carrie lay alone on a stretcher, her isolation magnified amidst the chaos.\n\n\"Kristopher...\" Fighting the dread creeping up her spine, Carrie pressed her lips together tightly and dialed her husband's number again, her resolve unwavering.\n\nYet, the call disconnected after a few short rings, leaving her with a haunting silence.\n\nJust then, a Twitter notification flickered on her phone screen.\n\nThe gossip feed was alive with the latest gossip: #LiseNash #MysteriouBoyfriend.\n\nAccording to the tweet, a producer from a well-known variety show had invited the renowned star Lise Nash to a dinner, which had quickly soured when she declined to partake in a toast.\n\nThis act of defiance had sparked a confrontation, only to be interrupted by Lise's domineering boyfriend. He stormed into the private dining room, dismissing the producer with a dismissive wave and escorting Lise away.\n\nThe tweet described the scene vividly, painting a picture of a powerful man defending his beloved partner.\n\nYet, perhaps due to his prominence, only the back of the man was visible in the accompanying photos, preserving his anonymity. Meanwhile, Lise, donning an oversized suit jacket, beamed a smile, reaching out to clasp his hand as they departed together.\n\nCarrie's eyes were glued to the screen, her stare intense and unblinking as she absorbed the image before her.\n\nThere he was--Kristopher Norris!\n\nThe suit jacket draped carelessly over Lise was a dead giveaway.\n\nEvery piece of clothing Kristopher owned had been meticulously tailored by a master craftsman abroad, a detail Carrie knew all too well.\n\nHer grip on her phone tightened, her knuckles blanching to a stark white, as if her very soul were being squeezed by an invisible hand, the pain sharp and acid-like in its intensity.\n\nIn her most desperate moment, Kristopher had coldly disconnected their call, choosing instead to be at Lise's side.\n\nWhat was the worth of their two-year marriage?\n\nThe tears she had been holding back now overwhelmed her, streaming down her face.\n\nEven as she tilted her head back in a futile attempt to stem the flow, the tears continued to escape.\n\nLise had always been Kristopher's first love, a fact whispered and gossiped about among their circles. The Norris family had never approved of Lise, seeing her ordinary background as unfitting.\n\nForced apart by family pressures, it had been Lise who ended things, but the past, it seemed, was not easily left behind.\n\nKristopher had diligently pursued the leadership of the Norris family, harboring dreams of finally being with Lise.\n\nYet, when he reached his goal, he discovered that Lise had already chosen another.\n\nIn defiance of his family's expectations and perhaps out of bitterness, Kristopher turned to Carrie, a woman equally devoid of wealth or status, to become Mrs. Norris, thereby blocking any matchmaking attempts by his relatives.\n\nAt that time, Carrie faced immense pressure from her father, Tristan Campbell, who was pushing her towards a marriage with a playboy, the son of a business associate, to cover her grandmother's steep medical expenses.\n\nBoth Kristopher and Carrie, driven by their personal motives, consented to a marriage of convenience.\n\nOriginally set for just one year, their contractual marriage stretched beyond its term, sustained by a shared understanding between them.\n\nOver time, Carrie began to believe in the authenticity of their union, never suspecting that it was merely an extension of her hopes.\n\nJust moments ago, a fire had nearly claimed Carrie's life. In that critical moment, she reached out to Kristopher, only to be twice rebuffed as he spent his time with Lise.\n\nThis harsh reality shattered Carrie's illusions, revealing that her perceived transition from pretense to genuine relationship was nothing but a facade maintained by her own desires.\n\nCarrie wasn't even a temporary substitute in Kristopher's life but merely a pawn used to spite his family.\n\nAfter a poignant pause, tears welled up in Carrie's eyes, unstoppable and poignant.\n\nIt might be time for her to release herself from the shackles of her own hopeful delusions--to stop deceiving herself.\n\nChapter 2 Trending Topics\nThe overwhelming number of injuries from the fire was staggering, straining the already frantic doctors and nurses as they tried to provide aid.\n\nCarrie had been merely grazed by a splintered clothes rack, which left a deep, jagged wound on her calf. In comparison to the chaos around her, her wounds seemed almost negligible.\n\nShe managed to get basic care--a brisk cleaning and a quick wrap of bandages--at a local hospital before catching a cab back to her house.\n\nBayview Villa, a grand property under Kristopher's name, was technically their matrimonial residence.\n\nLiving alone had become the norm for Carrie, as Kristopher was hardly ever around. She had bid farewell to the housekeeper, discovering that her life could be quite adequately maintained with just takeout, deliveries, and the occasional visit from a part-time cleaner.\n\nNow, she found herself the sole occupant of the sprawling living room, sinking into the sofa, her gaze drifting across the empty space.\n\nThe stark, monochrome decor did nothing to imbue warmth into the atmosphere.\n\nA chilling realization crept up on her: this vast, elegant space felt more like a colossal tomb, a silent grave for her lost years of youth and a love that had quietly slipped away.\n\nIn this cold, echoing house, would anyone even notice if her breath ceased one day?\n\nCarrie exhaled a weary sigh, her frame heavy as she leaned against the cold wall for support, struggling up the stairs to her bedroom on the second floor.\n\nEach step was a battle, sending stabbing pains shooting through her from the surface of her skin down to her aching bones.\n\nThe house, stark and hollow, echoed even the smallest sounds, magnifying her sense of isolation.\n\nIt was today, amidst this profound silence, that Carrie truly grasped the all-encompassing nature of her loneliness--it was almost tangible, enveloping her senses with its texture and mournful whispers, tightening around her heart like a vice, producing a dull, relentless ache.\n\nUpon reaching the sanctuary of her bedroom, she collapsed onto the bed, the very embodiment of exhaustion, feeling it both physically and spiritually.\n\nJust as she surrendered to this weariness, the sharp ring of the phone pierced the silence.\n\n\"You reached out to me earlier. What do you need?\" Kristopher's voice cut through the line, cold and distant as ever.\n\nCarrie was caught off guard by his unexpected call. Words failed her as she parted her lips to respond, but before she could collect her thoughts, a soft, feminine voice floated through from the other end. \"Kristopher, will you join me to...\"\n\nA surge of emotions tightened Carrie's grip on the phone, her heart thumping louder with each second. Overwhelmed and unable to contain her rising panic, she demanded, \"Who's there with you?\"\n\nKristopher gave no answer, merely stating in a flat, disinterested voice, \"If there's something you need, let's catch up when I'm back. I have pressing engagements right now, so I must disconnect.\"\n\nHe promptly ended the call, cutting off any chance for Carrie to reply.\n\nAs the harsh beep of the disconnected line filled her ears, Carrie's lips twisted into a rueful grin. How utterly foolish she felt! Deep down, she knew his response all too well, yet she had clung to the hope of hearing his voice confirm it.\n\nWith a sense of self-inflicted irony, Carrie activated her tablet and scrolled through the day's hot topics.\n\nOne headline caught her eye: \"A female star shielded from harassment at a dinner by her formidable partner.\" A wry smile twisted her lips.\n\nCarrie knew all too well what it was like to face harassment at those kinds of dinners.\n\nShe vividly remembered her first major audition after her entering the showbiz; her agent had escorted her to a dinner with the influential director and producer of the drama series \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nAs a novice in the dizzying world of showbiz, Carrie had felt incredibly vulnerable, uncertain of how to navigate the murky waters of such gatherings.\n\nThe producer had eyed her shamelessly, sneering as he asked, \"Is this the new talent you're introducing? She appears presentable, but I'm curious to see how she fares with a drink. Here's the deal, if you can gulp down this bottle in one go, I'll secure you an audition for the lead role.\"\n\nCarrie was inclined to decline, but under the relentless pressure from her agent, she found herself compelled to consume the entire bottle.\n\nAs the evening wore on, she was hurriedly taken to the hospital suffering from a severe stomach ailment.\n\nHer agent, fretful about the prospect of the role slipping away to another, quickly settled the hospital charges and departed.\n\nAt that time, Carrie found herself isolated in a hospital bed for several long days.\n\nYet, even before Carrie could be released from the hospital, the media was abuzz with the announcement that Lise had secured the lead role in \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nSubsequently, her agent rebuked Carrie for her lack of ambition, complaining, \"You are more appealing than Lise, so why can't you show more drive? She cozied up to Mr. Norris and hardly had to make an effort. She's surrounded by people eager to cater to her every need. I've heard that Mr. Norris personally orchestrated her landing the lead role in this production!\"\n\nWhen the show premiered, Lise was catapulted into stardom, swiftly ascending to the elite echelons of the acting world.\n\nFrom that moment forward, Carrie let her acting aspirations wane and chose instead to devote herself entirely to supporting her husband, Kristopher.\n\nAfter all, no matter her efforts, she could never get the same career opportunities that Lise seemed to receive effortlessly with Kristopher's offhand remarks.\n\nAt that time, Carrie had believed she was filling the role that was meant to be Lise's as Mrs. Norris, which meant she owed Lise.\n\nBy giving up the career opportunities to Lise, Carrie thought they would settle their unspoken debt.\n\nHowever, Carrie hadn't foreseen that Lise would claim both the coveted career and Kristopher's affections.\n\nAs Lise's professional and love life blossomed, Carrie came to the painful realization that she had been overly consumed with her romantic pursuits, at the expense of her career, and now, she found herself bereft of both love and professional fulfillment.\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Carrie viewed her past two years as tragically misguided.\n\nGiven another opportunity, she resolved she wouldn't be so unguarded, letting her heart recklessly fall captive to Kristopher's charm.\n\n\"Ms. Spencer, the new copyright contract is prepared. Please review it for any discrepancies.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed with the alert, snapping Carrie out of her reverie. She gazed at the PDF file attached in the message, her mind briefly overwhelmed.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Katrina Spencer, Carrie had once made a name for herself as a budding screenwriter, selling numerous scripts in her early days.\n\nDuring her early career as Katrina, Carrie often sold her work for a pittance, compelled by her urgent need for immediate cash.\n\nOver the years, these scripts transformed into blockbuster films and hit series, catapulting Katrina's reputation to new heights.\n\nBy this time, Carrie had married Kristopher and was no longer plagued by the financial woes that had once driven her to desperation--her grandmother's hefty medical bills were a thing of the past. With her financial crises resolved, Carrie's life had pivoted to domestic responsibilities, striving to be an exemplary wife to Kristopher. Amidst these changes, her pseudonym, Katrina Spencer, gradually receded into the background.\n\nHowever, her past as Katrina wasn't ready to be shelved just yet. Recently, an interested buyer had come forward, ready to pay a handsome sum for one of her old scripts.\n\nCarrie, however, was hesitant to sell. She raised several concerns about the contract presented to her, and to her astonishment, the buyer was genuine enough to revise it accordingly.\n\nHolding the revised contract in her hands, Carrie inhaled deeply, her resolve hardening. She seemed to have reached a crucial decision.\n\nHer fingers danced over her phone's keyboard with swift precision, typing out a firm command. \"Create a divorce agreement following my terms and ensure it reaches Kristopher Norris at the Norris Group.\"\n\nWithout pausing for a response, she placed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step echoing a blend of determination and newfound independence.\n\nChapter 3 Exchange Of Conveniences\nThirty minutes had passed, Carrie finally heaved herself up from the bathtub, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. As she lifted her gaze, her own image in the mirror halted her movements--her skin appeared as smooth and impeccable as fine porcelain, glowing with an unblemished radiance.\n\nHer eyes, deep pools of allure, sparkled with an enchanting, soft warmth, inviting anyone who dared meet her gaze.\n\nDespite edging into her late twenties at twenty-five, she reveled in the fact that time had yet to etch its marks upon her flawless complexion.\n\nSurely, a woman with such a visage had no place for self-pity.\n\nAbsorbed in her contemplation, Carrie carelessly extended her right leg onto the cold floor, forgetting it was the very limb she had injured. Wrapped excessively in cling film to shield it from moisture, the tight encasement had stifled her circulation, rendering her leg eerily numb. As her foot touched down, it betrayed her, slipping forward unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Carrie gasped, her arms flailing in a frantic ballet, searching for a lifeline in the void.\n\nJust as she teetered on the brink of a painful rendezvous with the floor, the bathroom door burst open.\n\nKristopher stood at the entrance, his suit immaculately tailored, creating a striking figure. As their eyes locked, he paused, visibly taken aback, then quickly closed the distance with brisk strides.\n\nCarrie's breath caught as Kristopher swept her up in a graceful bridal style, an unexpected tightness wrapping around her waist. Caught off guard by his sudden appearance, Carrie realized with a jolt that she was completely bare. A flush of embarrassment washed over her as she instinctively clutched her hands over her chest.\n\nThis was their first moment of such intimacy since their wedding, and the discomfort made her toes curl inward, her skin blushing a delicate shade of pink.\n\nKristopher looked down at her with a mischievous grin. \"Let's be honest, there's not much to see,\" he teased gently.\n\nFeeling both mortified and slightly irritated, Carrie snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Norris, after all you've seen, I suppose nothing can impress you anymore.\"\n\nShe carried her C-cup curves with understated charm, a touch of sensuality that outshone Lise's painfully flat, almost awkwardly rigid build.\n\nYet Carrie knew well that without love, even the most perfect physique paled in comparison to the charm of one dearly cherished.\n\nNonchalantly, Kristopher reached for a bathrobe hanging behind the door and draped it over her. His frown deepened at her comment. \"What are you talking about, Carrie?\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike him, and his expression grew even more impatient. \"Tell me, did you send those divorce papers in the dead of night just to lure me back here--to catch you completely bare?\" His tone was a mix of disbelief and annoyance. \"I told you I was swamped with work. Was this dramatic display really necessary?\"\n\nCarrie's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the tension between them. He was always so quick to lose patience with her.\n\nShe wasn't the type to throw around words like divorce or breakups lightly. In fact, this was the first time she'd ever mentioned divorce in their two-year marriage, yet he seemed indifferent to her turmoil. He simply dismissed her concerns as if she were overreacting about trivial matters.\n\nDespite the throbbing pain in her leg, Carrie mustered her strength and said, \"Put me down.\"\n\nKristopher, however, paid no heed, his eyes scanning her leg swathed in bandages. His brow furrowed slightly. \"What happened to your leg? Is this some elaborate ploy to lure me back?\"\n\nAt his words, a bitter laugh escaped Carrie.\n\nIt seemed he viewed her as merely seeking attention, and in failing to capture it, she had likely concocted a story to draw him back, allowing her to dramatize her plight in his presence.\n\nWith a blank face, she replied untruthfully, \"It's a beauty treatment that shouldn't get wet.\"\n\n\"Why did you suddenly decide to undergo such a treatment?\" Kristopher inquired, his tone casual as he carried her outside, not pressing the issue further.\n\nHis frame was large, and through his thin shirt, she could distinctly feel the warmth of his body and the defined shape of his chest muscles.\n\nThe closeness created an uncomfortable tension for Carrie, who had resolved to end things once and for all.\n\nHer voice climbed involuntarily, sharper this time. \"Oh, since when have you been concerned with such minor things, Mr. Norris?\"\n\nFor the first time, Kristopher witnessed her using biting sarcasm; it struck him as peculiarly amusing. With a calm demeanor, he responded, \"You're my wife, it's only natural I'd be concerned about your well-being.\"\n\n\"Really?\" There was a somber note in Carrie's voice now. \"It seems like you've never really regarded me as your wife. I'm scared that if I were to die, you wouldn't even know until much later.\"\n\nAfter all, at that very moment, Kristopher had been distracted, lost in moments with his first love, too consumed to lend an ear to her desperate pleas.\n\nCaught off guard by her accusation, Kristopher's eyes widened with surprise before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. \"Carrie, what's brought on this sudden outburst of anger? Just because I was tied up this afternoon and missed your call? Perhaps I've been too indulgent with you lately, and it's made you a bit too presumptuous?\"\n\nCarrie froze, startled. Was he accusing her of being too presumptuous?\n\nShe realized their marriage had always been lopsided. In his eyes, she was nothing more than a transactional partner, a woman who had bartered her freedom for financial security.\n\nTheir union was meant to be a mere exchange of conveniences, yet she had, quite foolishly, fallen deeply in love with him.\n\nIn the tricky terrain of romance, the one who fell first invariably found themselves at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nKristopher's dismissive reaction left Carrie reeling, her emotions dismissed as trifles, a tight knot of suffocation rising in her chest.\n\n\"I said to put me down this instant!\" Carrie exclaimed, jerking her head to the side, her voice laced with a sharp edge of impatience.\n\nKristopher remained mute, effortlessly carrying her towards the bed before suddenly releasing his hold.\n\nCarrie felt a jolt as the support vanished, her heart skipping a beat as she instinctively grasped for him.\n\nTheir bodies collided on the bed, her bathrobe teetering on the brink of decency, threatening to unravel with any minor shift.\n\nPropped on one elbow, Kristopher gazed down at her, his lips curled into a sly, teasing grin. \"You wanted to be let go, didn't you? So why cling to me now?\"\n\nHis eyes, deep and sparkling like a midnight lake speckled with stars, captivated her.\n\nIn those celestial depths, Carrie caught a glimpse of her own reflection.\n\nAt times like this, she was misled into believing he harbored a deep affection.\n\nSadly, his heart was a fortress reserved for Lise, and all Carrie had left were empty fantasies.\n\n\"Boring!\" she exclaimed, her voice devoid of any enthusiasm as she attempted to rise, her hand inadvertently brushing against something unexpected.\n\nThe following moment brought a noticeable shift in his cock pressing against her stomach.\n\n\"Don't move, or I can't promise what might happen next,\" he warned in a deep, gravelly voice.\n\nWith a frown, Carrie internally cursed upon hearing the statement.\n\nIt was an undeniable fact. Primal instincts steered the actions of men. Absence of affection didn't quell their basic desires.\n\nYet, she dared not agitate Kristopher. Angling her face away, her body remained rigid, frozen in place.\n\nCarrie, feeling irked, shot back. \"Didn't you say there's nothing here to see? What's with the reaction now, Mr. Norris? Are you really that easy to impress?\"\n\nNo sooner had her words flown than she grasped the potential repercussions of her sharp tongue.\n\nA wave of regret surged through Carrie, but instead of anger, Kristopher responded with a chuckle, \"You are my wife, after all. Since that's something I can't alter, I might as well embrace it. Besides, it's been years since we became husband and wife--it would be a shame to neglect you completely.\"\n\nChapter 4 Are You Out Of Your Mind?\nKristopher slipped his hand beneath the folds of her bathrobe, his touch tracing the curve of Carrie's skin, as smooth and delicate as silk. He encircled her slender waist, drawing her closer with a gentle yet firm grip.\n\nHer face, a captivating canvas of defiance and visible irritation, ignited in him an uncontrollable urge to claim victory over her resistance.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy, yet he remained composed, slowly removing his tailored suit.\n\nThe fabric of his suit brushed lightly against Carrie's cheek, releasing a mix of scents: a familiar woody aroma intertwined with an unexpected zesty twist of lemon. It was unmistakably Jo Malone's Blue Agava and Cacao--Lise's signature scent.\n\nA surge of nausea overwhelmed Carrie at the realization.\n\nAs Kristopher's eyes, now shaded with a stormy intensity, drew nearer to hers, the proximity conjured unwelcome visions of him with Lise. Her stomach churned violently, and with a sudden movement, she pushed him away, propping herself up with a jolt and a dry retch.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer stomach had been empty all day, leaving her with nothing to bring up.\n\nThe desire in Kristopher's gaze flickered out, replaced by a cold, detached expression as he withdrew slightly.\n\nObserving the genuine distress and the reddening of Carrie's eyes, Kristopher perceived her reaction for outright disgust at their closeness.\n\nHe paused, fingers adjusting his shirt cuffs, his voice cold as he confronted her. \"Carrie, is this reaction reserved only for me, or is it how you respond to all men?\"\n\nThe air in the room turned frosty, thick with tension.\n\nCarrie swallowed the sharp sting in her throat, her eyes widening in shock as she stared up at him.\n\nEver since their marriage, she had cut ties with nearly all her male friends, yet here was Kristopher, casually tossing out comments sharp enough to cut glass.\n\nThe years of love she had poured into their relationship now seemed utterly futile.\n\nHeat crept up her neck, coloring her cheeks a bright scarlet as indignation took hold. Without thinking, her hand flew up and delivered a stinging slap across Kristopher's face.\n\nAll her suppressed grievances from the day ignited in that swift motion.\n\nHer bathrobe, loosened in the heat of the moment, slipped from her shoulders. Ignoring the flush of exposure, she swiftly gathered the fabric and draped it around herself, her movements quick and firm.\n\nThe impact of her slap had left a light, crimson mark on Kristopher's cheek, marking him with her outrage.\n\nHis eyes, wide with disbelief, met hers. \"Carrie, are you out of your mind?\"\n\nOut of her mind? Yes, she was clearly insane to ever fall for him in the first place.\n\nCarrie fumed silently, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nSuddenly, the sharp buzz of the phone on the table cut through the mounting tension, its vibration bringing a brief respite from their standoff.\n\nKristopher cast a fleeting glance at the message, shut off the phone with a snap, and strode towards the door, his back rigid with tension.\n\nHer voice, firm and unwavering, chased after him. \"We're getting a divorce! Make sure you sign those papers before you walk out that door!\"\n\nKristopher paused briefly and said sharply, \"I have something to do now. When I return, do whatever pleases you.\" With that, he forcefully shut the door.\n\nCarrie's eyes followed his unwavering exit, feeling an oppressive weight compressing her chest once again.\n\nShe disregarded the sharp sting in her leg and hobbled determinedly toward her tablet. Fingers trembling, she hastily navigated to Lise's Twitter page.\n\nLise had just uploaded a new tweet.\n\nThe photo showed her lying down with a fever patch adhered to her forehead, still enveloped in Kristopher's familiar jacket.\n\nThe caption read, \"Being sick makes me extra clingy. Wishing I had someone here. Stay cozy and take care, everyone!\"\n\nThe simultaneous timing of these two events made it almost impossible for Carrie not to suspect that Kristopher had dashed off to tend to Lise.\n\nCarrie's instincts loudly proclaimed that this was no accident; Lise had deliberately sought to tug at Kristopher's heartstrings. It appeared her tactics were effective.\n\nNot even Carrie's stark threat of divorce could overshadow Lise's theatrical display of vulnerability.\n\nSeething with fury, Carrie quaked like a leaf swept into a storm.\n\nShe steeled herself against the heartache, forcefully ripping the plastic wrap from her aching leg.\n\nAfter her lengthy soak, the bath's lingering moisture had infiltrated her skin, inflaming the wound until it was a vivid, angry red and painfully swollen.\n\nShe, too, could be clingy. Even in the harshest times back in the county, she had shown vulnerability, breaking down into soft sobs within the comforting arms of her grandmother, especially that one time she got burned by the scalding kettle.\n\nBut such vulnerability had its time and place, and it wasn't now.\n\nThe stark reality of Kristopher's exit forced Carrie to confront her need for self-reliance.\n\nBiting down hard on her lip, Carrie cleaned the throbbing wound with a practiced hand before securely wrapping it anew.\n\nShe rose with a newfound resolve and yanked a black suitcase from the far end of her expansive walk-in closet--it held all the belongings she'd brought into this house as a hopeful bride.\n\nShe grabbed a fresh set of clothes to slip into and left a bank card neatly on the bedside table.\n\nShe had transferred every penny she'd earned over the past year onto that card, effectively settling her financial entanglements with Kristopher over the last two years and cutting him out of her life for good.\n\nDragging the heavy suitcase behind her, she limped painfully out of the opulent villa.\n\nAs she passed through the gate, she wrapped her baseball jacket more tightly around her slight figure, her silhouette hauntingly solitary in the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe night air of early spring was bitingly cold, devoid of any trace of warmth, a chill that seemed almost faint compared to the ice forming in Carrie's shattered heart.\n\nShe had arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a heart full of dreams, and now she was leaving, dreams crumbled, utterly alone.\n\nA bitter laugh slipped through her lips. If only she hadn't fallen so hard for him, if only she'd proposed an amicable separation at the end of their agreed year, maybe she wouldn't be wandering now, a lost soul in the shadow of her former self.\n\nLise didn't have to lift a finger, and Carrie had already fallen, utterly broken and beyond redemption.\n\nChapter 5 A Gathering\nMeanwhile, in the Oasis Club, renowned as the priciest spot in Orkset, the air within the VIP room crackled with excitement. Under the spell of bright lights and thumping music, a diverse group of men and women lounged together, basking in the exclusivity of the setting.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, revealing Kristopher in the doorway.\n\nThe karaoke session halted abruptly as the crowd turned to greet him in unison, voices mingling. \"Kristopher...\"\n\nBefore they could utter another word, a woman cloaked from head to toe stepped out from behind him.\n\nLise, with a fluid motion, removed her mask and slid her arm through Kristopher's. She addressed the room with a poised charm. \"My assistant took a sudden leave, and I found myself without company. Not keen on spending the evening alone, I invited Kristopher to join me. I trust that's alright?\"\n\nLise's beauty was without question. Her face was a delicate composition of cherry lips and a sculpted nose, framed by eyes that shimmered with a vulnerable allure, commanding a protective fervor from those around her--her presence, ethereal.\n\nIn contrast, Carrie's features were more pronounced, her beauty vivid and striking. Lise, by comparison, carried a softer, more understated elegance.\n\nYet, as it often goes, matters of the heart followed no simple paths.\n\nWhile Kristopher and Carrie were married, it was in name only; Kristopher seemed detached and seldom included her in private social events.\n\nThe group didn't have much of a relationship with Carrie, leading them to feel no obligation to defend her.\n\nUpon hearing Lise's comment, a moment of discomfort rippled through the air. Nonetheless, they quickly recovered, offering a congenial smile as they said, \"We're all friends here; let's not bother with formalities.\"\n\nLise offered a subtle, knowing smile, as she gracefully accompanied Kristopher into the bustling room.\n\nThe event that evening had been meticulously planned to express appreciation for Kristopher's contributions.\n\nAs they stepped into the room, the crowd parted like the sea, making way for them to proceed to the seats of honor.\n\nThe group's leader handed Kristopher a glass of wine with a flourish, proclaiming with a broad grin, \"We truly owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Norris! Your exceptional talents are the talk of the town, and witnessing them firsthand today only confirms it. Without your expertise, securing this contract would have been a fantasy!\"\n\nTheir gathering marked the launch of a novel shopping platform, one that had been in negotiation with numerous local brands in Orkset. But the scenario changed dramatically when the tech giant JoyBuy dramatically entered the scene, stirring up the competitive landscape.\n\nCompeting with JoyBuy was akin to the classic David versus Goliath tale--hopelessly daunting. In a surge of desperation, they turned to Kristopher, reaching out through a network of connections for his renowned strategic prowess.\n\nWith his characteristic swiftness, Kristopher hatched an ingenious plan and swiftly secured the deal, snatching it from the clutches of JoyBuy right before the business association could ink their agreement--a masterful coup that reverberated success.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround only intensified the already deep respect everyone held for Kristopher.\n\nAlbin Murray, beaming with pride, couldn't help but boast, \"Ah, just look at the caliber of his friends! They thought they could steal deals right under our noses, obviously underestimating Kristopher's clout!\"\n\nAlbin, born into the wealthy Murray family, counted himself among Kristopher's closest friends. He was renowned for his sprawling social web--a network through which the desperate plea for help was channeled to Kristopher.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristopher himself, the focus of all their discussions, reclined nonchalantly on the couch, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe was well-versed in the art of receiving compliments; thus, his expression stayed calm and detached.\n\nThe ambient light sculpted his angular features, casting dramatic shadows that emphasized his high nose bridge and sharply cut jawline, as though he were a living masterpiece.\n\nHis natural grace and detachment eclipsed any terrestrial magnificence.\n\nFollowing a sequence of celebratory toasts, when it became apparent that Kristopher merely touched his glass without truly drinking, the rest of the company toned down their conversation, allowing him a moment of repose with his eyes gently shut.\n\nLise, slightly feverish, opted not to indulge in the spirits, choosing instead to sit in serene silence next to Kristopher, her eyes lingering on him with a look of deep, unmistakable adoration.\n\nAlbin, captivated by the seemingly perfect pair, pondered the whims of destiny. He discreetly captured their image with his smartphone and nonchalantly shared it across his social networks.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the liquor dwindled, the room's door swung open anew.\n\nKristopher's personal assistant, Oliver Brooks, made his entrance, acknowledging the gathering with a courteous nod that bordered on respect but avoided groveling, swiftly positioning himself in front of Kristopher.\n\nSilence hung in the air, yet Lise, unable to contain her curiosity, leaned in and whispered, \"What's going on?\"\n\nOliver, maintaining his focus on Kristopher, chose not to respond directly to her.\n\nA flush of embarrassment tinted Lise's cheeks as she turned towards Kristopher, hesitatingly inquiring, \"Should I leave?\"\n\nKristopher adjusted his posture, his voice low and calm as he instructed, \"Go ahead, speak.\"\n\nA shiver of apprehension coursed through Oliver as he tentatively began, \"Mr. Norris, Mrs. Norris has departed from Bayview Villa, and...\"\n\n&9&\n0:00 / 4:52",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:24",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:24",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:24",

        "primary_text": "She was the long-lost daughter that everyone had been searching for, yet her family scorned her. Her brothers constantly blamed and insulted her while showering affection on the imposter. Heartbroken, she left home and married a mysterious tycoon.\n=====\n\"Noelle, get down on your knees and say sorry to Willa right now!\"\nA man's voice rang out, sharp and cold, resounding across the spacious living room.\nNoelle Moss stood frozen in the center of the room, her long lashes lowered as she tightened her grip on the voice recorder tucked inside her pocket.\nHer eyes slowly lifted toward the man on the sofa--her third brother, Gerard Moss.\nNext to him sat Willa Moss, the adopted daughter of the Moss family. She wasn't even related to them by bl**d.\nYet she was being told by her own elder brother to kneel down and apologize to Willa.\n\"You shoved Willa down the stairs on purpose. How could you be so cruel? You're utterly disgusting! I refuse to acknowledge someone like you as my sister!\" Gerard snapped.\nUtterly disgusting?\n\nNoelle's lashes quivered faintly as she fought to hold back the tight, aching pressure in her ch**t. \"I didn't--\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Gerard grabbed a glass from the table and threw it hard at her. \"How dare you talk back!\"\n\nThe glass hit her foot and then crashed on the floor, shattering into countless fragments.\n\nNoelle's delicate foot instantly turned red and began to swell.\n\nThin slivers of glass shards cut across her smooth leg, drawing fresh, bright red bl**d.\n\nBut Noelle didn't flinch. She just stood there as though none of it hurt.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gerard had shouted at her like this--or hurt her.\n\n\"Gerard, please... Don't be so harsh on Noelle,\" Willa said quickly, her voice light and gentle.\n\n\"She didn't push me on purpose. It wasn't her fault. It was just an accident. Really--it was my own fault.\"\n\nGerard's heart melted suddenly at her words.\n\n\"Why are you still defending her, Willa? Have you thought about what would have happened if you ended up with a scar? You're a girl. That's not something to take lightly!\"\n\n\"But Gerard...\"\n\n\"That's enough. Stop defending her. Come closer--let me see if you're hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gerard. It's nothing...\"\n\nSeeing them play out their familial roles, Noelle felt a deep, draining weariness settle over her.\n\nGerard was so worried about whether Willa might mar her look. But moments ago, he had hurled a glass at her with no hesitation, leaving her leg bl**ding.\n\nDid he think she couldn't be scarred? Didn't it matter that she--his own sister by bl**d--might also be concerned about her looks?\n\nNoelle had learned to survive on her own from a young age, growing up in an orphanage with no one to rely on.\n\nLater on, an elderly couple, Jeffery and Babette Hobbes, took her in and raised her with warmth and care. Under their care, she'd never been mistreated, never made to feel like a burden.\n\nAfter fussing over Willa, Gerard turned and caught sight of the faint, mocking smile on Noelle's beautiful face. He almost went wild with irritation.\n\n\"What are you smirking at? Noelle, we made it clear when we brought you back two years ago--Willa was raised in this house. Even if you're not related by bl**d, you're expected to treat her like your own sister. You, as the older one, are supposed to protect her--spoil her! But what have you done since you returned?\"\n\nNoelle smiled bitterly. Her lips, soft and rose-colored, trembled slightly.\n\nTwo years ago, when the Moss family came looking for her and claimed her as one of their own, she thought she'd finally found her people.\n\nJeffery and Babette had already passed away, and with no one left, she clung to the idea of reuniting with her family.\n\nShe even turned down a generous offer to live with him from Levi Martin, Jeffery's old friend--just so she could live with the Mosses.\n\nFor two years, she'd done everything she could to fit in. She'd put up with more than anyone should have, always backing down.\n\nShe always gave Willa the nicest things. Only accepting what Willa rejected. She lived like a shadow behind her, never asking for more.\n\nShe truly believed that if she kept being patient and kind, the family would slowly start to accept her. That maybe her parents and five brothers would see her as part of them.\n\nBut all she got in return was their endless praise for Willa and constant blame thrown at her. Every mistake was always her fault.\n\nOne day, she had overheard something that shattered her completely. \"If only Noelle had died out there, our family would've been free of such a burden.\"\n\nIf only Noelle had died out there?\n\nThose words had clamped around her heart like an iron fist. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't move.\n\nWhy? Why did they hate her that much? What had she done to deserve such coldness from her own family?\n\nWhat made her so unbearable to them that they wished she'd died before ever returning?\n\nAnd if they truly felt that way, then why bring her back in the first place two years ago?\n\nShe closed her eyes. Her heart felt like an empty pond now. There was no emotion left in it.\n\nThat was it. She'd had enough. She didn't want this family anymore. She didn't want to chase after people who only saw her as a mistake.\n\nWhen Gerard looked up again, Noelle's face had changed. There was no pain, no sadness. Only calm.\n\nA strange kind of calm that unsettled him. It was as if she had finally let go of something.\n\nHe raised his palm, ready to sl*p her, and warned, \"If you still won't kneel and apologize to Willa, I'll teach you a lesson!\"\n\nBut before he could strike, a hand shot up and grabbed his wrist.\n\nIt was Noelle.\n\nShe had stopped him.\n\n\"You--\" Gerard stared in disbelief. For two years, Noelle had never fought back.\n\nShe'd always accepted whatever punishment they gave. But now... now she had the nerve to stand up to him?\n\nNoticing the shock on Gerard's face, Noelle let out a quiet, sarcastic laugh, her stunning face glowing with a newfound boldness.\n\n\"I said I didn't push Willa.\"\n\nGerard looked shocked. \"Still lying? You've got some nerve!\"\n\n\"Gerard,\" Noelle said, her eyes turning cold, empty of any emotion.\n\n\"If I can show proof that I didn't push her, then you and Willa will kneel and apologize to me.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" For a second, he thought he'd misheard. Then his anger exploded.\n\n\"You want me to kneel to you? You arrogant little b**t!\"\n\nHe refused to accept someone so shameful as his sister.\n\nOn the sofa, Willa had been enjoying the chaos. She was waiting for Gerard to put Noelle in her place.\n\nBut when she heard Noelle's words, a flicker of doubt crossed her eyes.\n\nProof? What kind of proof could she have?\n\nStill, Willa quickly masked her mockery and got up, putting on a gentle act. \"Gerard, please, don't be mad anymore. Let it go. It's not worth it--\"\n\n\"Stop defending her!\" Gerard snapped, his voice thunderous. \"I want to see this so-called proof she thinks she has!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She silently reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, sleek device.\n\nWilla's heart dropped. Her eyes locked on it, and for a second, her face lost all color.\n\nA voice recorder. How had Noelle done this? How did she have a voice recorder?\n\nNoelle didn't say a word. She pressed play.\n\nThere was a short buzz of static, and then the sound of a sweet, carefully controlled voice filled the room. \"Noelle, what do you think of this spot?\"\n\nGerard immediately recognized it--Willa's voice.\n\nThen came another voice. Calm, light. \"Willa, why are you standing at the top of the stairs?\"\n\nGerald knew that was Noelle's voice.\n\nThe next moment, Willa's soft voice filled the room once more, but this time, her words were malicious.\n\n\"Noelle, if I tell Gerard you pushed me down the stairs, how do you think he'll punish you?\"\n\nChapter 2 Could It Be Him?\nGerard whipped his head around to look at Willa, his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nWilla--the sweet, innocent little sister he'd always protected--had said something like that?\n\nWilla's heart skipped. Panic flickered across her eyes and she quickly tried to save herself. \"Gerard, no! That's not how it happened! It's not true!\"\n\nBut the recording didn't care about her excuses. It kept playing, clear and damning.\n\nNext came Noelle's steady voice, calm but with a hint of warning. \"Willa, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n\nWilla's voice followed--this time, sharp and cruel. \"Even if you try to stop me, it's useless. You know Gerard will always take my side. He never believes you.\"\n\nThen, her tone changed completely, becoming panicked and fake.\n\n\"Waaah, Gerard, hurry! Noelle's trying to push me down the stairs! She said I don't deserve to be part of the Moss family, that I don't belong here. She's trying to throw me out! I'm so scared. Waaah, Gerard, help me!\"\n\nGerard just stood there, everything finally clicking into place.\n\nNoelle never pushed Willa. She was set up. Willa had gone to the edge of the stairs on purpose, faked fear, and used it all to frame Noelle.\n\nNoelle had been innocent from start to finish. And he--he'd fallen for it. He'd thrown accusations at his own sister.\n\nGerard looked away, guilt twisting in his ch**t. Then he frowned, his voice came out defensive. \"Noelle... even if I got it wrong... why didn't you just explain everything earlier?\"\n\nNoelle's eyes flickered with cold, mocking amusement. Of course. Her brother had finally figured out he was wrong, yet somehow it was still her fault for not explaining it better.\n\n\"Gerard, looks like your memory's giving out before your age does.\"\n\n\"I...\" He opened his mouth, but no words came.\n\nIt hit him all at once--just minutes earlier, Noelle had tried to speak up. She had clearly told him she didn't push Willa.\n\nAnd what did he do? He cut her off, didn't give her a chance to finish, didn't believe a word she said.\n\nInstead, he lost his temper, grabbed a glass, and threw it at her in rage. Bl**d was still dripping from the cuts on her leg made by the shattered glass.\n\nShame and disappointment sizzled inside him as he slowly turned toward Willa.\n\nWilla's eyes were brimming with tears now, her face pale and trembling.\n\n\"Gerard... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have lied about Noelle. I just... I just didn't want to lose you. Or anyone of the family.\"\n\nHis brow creased. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nNoticing that Gerard's attitude had softened, Willa sensed an opening. Maybe she could still fix this.\n\nHer expression grew even more pitiful, and the tears started falling faster, streaming down her cheeks without pause.\n\n\"I've lived in the Moss house all my life. I've always seen you as my real brother. I've always loved your parents like they were truly mine. But ever since Noelle came back, I've been scared. I thought you'd stop loving me. That all of you would push me aside because she's the real daughter... because she's more beautiful than me. I was so scared of losing you that I panicked and did something awful to Noelle. Gerard, I know I messed up. I swear, it won't ever happen again!\"\n\nThe sight of her crying tugged at Gerard's heart.\n\nNow, hearing her emotional confession, Gerard felt even more touched. How could someone like Willa mean any real harm? She just cared too deeply about their family. That was all.\n\nHe looked back at Noelle, his tone softer now. \"Willa only lied because she was scared of losing her family. You didn't really get seriously hurt. Can't you be the bigger person, as her older sister? Just let it go and forgive her this once.\"\n\nNoelle felt a bitter laugh building in her ch**t.\n\nHer own brother had just learned the truth, and still, instead of defending her, he asked her to forgive the person who set her up.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nShe couldn't take another minute in this house. The Moss family's double standards were unbearable. It made her feel sick.\n\nGerard, completely unaware of how twisted his thinking sounded, kept speaking like he was above it all.\n\n\"Noelle, if you're going to stay stuck on this and refuse to forgive Willa, then don't blame me when I kick you out of this house!\"\n\nNoelle didn't react. Her face stayed blank, her beautiful features unreadable, but her eyes were cold.\n\n\"You don't have to kick me out,\" she said. \"I'm done. From this moment on, I have nothing to do with the Moss family. I won't spend another second in this place.\"\n\nWithout another word, she turned and walked toward her room.\n\nHow ridiculous it was. She had spent two whole years under this roof, and she barely owned enough to fill a single suitcase.\n\nShe packed quickly, grabbing the few things that were hers, along with her documents. Then, ignoring the stinging pain in her leg, she used a tissue to wipe away the bl**d.\n\nThere wasn't time to treat the cuts properly, so she just stuck a few Band-Aids over them.\n\nShe changed into a long dress to cover the wounds, zipped her suitcase, and pulled it out of the cold, empty room she had once tried to call home.\n\nWhen Gerard saw her come out with a suitcase, it finally hit him. She wasn't just angry. She wasn't bluffing. She was leaving for real, truly ready to break all ties with the Moss family.\n\nHis face twisted with rage. \"Noelle, think carefully. If you walk out that door today, don't expect to come crawling back! You'll regret it!\"\n\nNoelle didn't flinch. She didn't even turn around. Her voice was steady. \"I won't regret it.\"\n\nWilla stood by, her heart racing with joy. Finally. Finally, Noelle was leaving!\n\nWith her gone, everything that was supposed to be Noelle's would belong to her--the Moss family's love, attention, and Noelle's portion of the family wealth. All hers.\n\nStill, she kept her face carefully controlled.\n\nBubbling with excitement but putting on the worried act, she said, \"Gerard, go after her! What if something happens to her out there? She's all alone--what if someone hurts her?\"\n\n\"Let her go,\" Gerard replied with a snort, eyes full of disdain. \"She'll be begging to come back in a few days. And when she does, I'll make sure she learns her place.\"\n\nJust then, a bodyguard rushed inside, out of breath and wide-eyed.\n\nHe barely acknowledged Noelle as she passed him with her suitcase. Everyone in the house knew the truth--Noelle didn't really matter.\n\nShe had no status here. She wasn't someone the staff needed to show respect to. Willa was the one they answered to.\n\nThe bodyguard's voice was loud and urgent. \"Mr. Moss, Miss Moss! An important guest has just arrived! Their car is parked right outside. I think it's... from the Martin family!\"\n\nThe Martin family?\n\nGerard and Willa exchanged stunned glances, their excitement growing in an instant.\n\nThe Martin family was at the very top of Cielrora's elite circle.\n\nSure, the Moss family had wealth and status, but compared to the Martins, they were small players.\n\nThe Martins had power that stretched back generations. They were the definition of true nobility.\n\nFor years, the Moss family had tried to connect with them, dreaming of a business alliance, but nothing had ever come of it.\n\nAnd now--now, someone from the Martins had come to them?\n\n\"Quick, let's go welcome them!\" Gerard said, voice shaky with excitement as he hurriedly smoothed his clothes and signaled the guard to lead the way.\n\nWilla followed, fixing her dress. Her cheeks flushed slightly with anticipation as she followed.\n\nShe couldn't help but wonder--who from the Martin family had shown up? Could it possibly be... him?\n\nChapter 3 Her Future Husband\nGerard and Willa had quickened their pace, somehow making it to the villa's entrance before Noelle.\n\nJust as the bodyguard had said, a sleek black car, polished but without flash, sat quietly by the curb.\n\nWhen Gerard saw clearly the model of the vehicle, his breath caught. This limited limo... His heart thudded against his ribs.\n\nThere was only one man in Cielrora who could drive this limited limo--Ethan Martin.\n\nEthan, head of the powerful Martin family and CEO of Martin Group, was more than a businessman--he was the city's most influential figure, the kind of man people rarely saw unless summoned.\n\nFor Ethan to come here in person today--it was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nA wave of excitement lit up Gerard's face as he rushed toward the car, his voice suddenly full of flattery and nervous respect.\n\n\"Mr. Martin! Good day! We had no idea you'd be visiting. Please forgive us for not receiving you properly!\"\n\nHe stood there, waiting. But no one answered. The car remained still. No window rolled down. The door didn't move. It was as if no one had heard him.\n\nWhat was happening? Gerard's smile froze in place.\n\nWilla stepped forward next. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with delicate grace, her tone soft and sweet. \"Mr. Martin, what an honor to have you here. May I ask what brings you?\"\n\nStill nothing. No sound. No movement.\n\nGerard and Willa glanced at each other, confused.\n\nThere was no doubt about it--it was definitely Ethan's car. Still, no matter how many times they greeted him politely, not a single word came back. Just silence.\n\nThe tension hung thick in the air until, all at once, the front passenger door opened and a man, clearly someone's assistant, stepped out.\n\nGerard instantly recognized him--Ruben Douglas. Ethan's right-hand man.\n\nGerard quickly recalibrated. Of course. It made sense. Given their family's current position, they weren't worth Ethan's personal time. Sending Ruben was already generous.\n\nRuben, being Ethan's top assistant, wasn't just some background staff. Earning his favor could still bring valuable opportunities to the Moss family.\n\nOnce he'd gathered his thoughts, Gerard forced a friendly smile and stepped forward. \"Mr. Douglas, good day! What brings you--\"\n\nBut Ruben didn't spare him a look. Without a word, he walked right past Gerard and Willa, making his way toward Noelle, who stood quietly a short distance away.\n\nThat moment left Gerard and Willa cold. A shiver ran through them as they stood rooted to the spot, too stunned to move.\n\nRuben stopped in front of Noelle and gave a respectful bow. \"Good day, Miss Moss. I'm here on Mr. Levi Martin's behalf to escort you to the Martin estate.\"\n\nLevi Martin?\n\nHearing the name, a gentle warmth spread through Noelle's ch**t. So it was Levi.\n\nThough she'd spent her early years in an orphanage, she'd been adopted later by Jeffery and Babette, who had raised her kindly.\n\nLevi, Jeffery's close friend, had once played with her as a little girl.\n\nRuben held a watch in his hand--the same one Levi had worn for as long as Noelle could remember. That alone confirmed he had truly sent Ruben to get her.\n\nSince the invitation came from Jeffery's friend, Noelle had no choice but to accept. She nodded with quiet respect. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're very welcome, Miss Moss,\" Ruben said with a pleasant smile, effortlessly taking her suitcase from her hands.\n\nHe placed it carefully in the trunk, and then opened the rear door for her. \"Miss Moss, please.\"\n\nNoelle bent down to step in--but paused. Someone was already inside.\n\nA man.\n\nHe sat in the back seat, one leg crossed over the other with an easy confidence. He wore a spotless white shirt, buttoned all the way up. His posture was composed.\n\nIn his hands was a neat stack of papers, and his long fingers moved smoothly as he flipped through them one by one.\n\nAt the sound of the door opening, the man slowly looked up from the documents and turned to face her.\n\nNoelle's gaze met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes that seemed to hold more than they revealed.\n\n\"I'm Ethan Martin,\" he said, his voice low and husky, with a relaxed kind of confidence. \"I'm here on my grandfather's behalf to bring you home.\"\n\nEthan Martin?\n\nThe name, so familiar yet strangely distant, sent a wave of childhood memories rushing through Noelle's mind.\n\nJeffery had once mentioned a marriage arrangement to her years ago. The chosen future husband for her? Levi's grandson--Ethan.\n\nAnd now, the man sitting before her... was him? Her future husband?\n\nShe slid into the back seat slowly, trying to gather her thoughts as the black car pulled away from the Moss family residence.\n\nGerard and Willa were still standing outside, too stunned to move. Their expressions were frozen--shock mixed with disbelief.\n\nThey'd spent years trying to impress the Martin family. And now, the Martins had shown up--for Noelle? And Ruben, with complete respect, had personally invited Noelle into Ethan's car?\n\nThe whole time, he hadn't so much as looked their way--treating them like they didn't matter at all. How was this possible?\n\nWilla's jaw tightened, her sweet smile long gone. Being outshone by Noelle had always rubbed her the wrong way.\n\nBut this... this was something else. It felt like she'd been slapped in public.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the car, Noelle kept her eyes low, stealing cautious glances at the breathtaking man beside her.\n\nBut all she could think about was whether he remembered the marriage arrangement.\n\nGod, she hoped he didn't.\n\nThe whole idea felt childish now. Outdated. Ridiculous.\n\nBut Ethan seemed to read her mind without even trying.\n\nHe looked at her, one brow lifting slightly. His throat shifted as he spoke, voice calm and steady. \"I remember.\"\n\nNoelle's heart skipped.\n\nOf all the outcomes she'd imagined, this was the one she feared most.\n\nTo put it simply, their relationship had always been complicated.\n\nEven though she was adopted, Jeffery and Babette had given her a good life.\n\nJeffery had powerful friends, and among them was Levi, the former head of the influential Martin family.\n\nNaturally, Levi had often visited--with Ethan in tow. That was how she and Ethan had first crossed paths.\n\nAs kids, they spent a lot of time together. Maybe too much. The adults had taken that as a sign and arranged for the two of them to get married someday.\n\nBack then, Noelle was too young to really understand what a marriage arrangement meant.\n\nBut as she got older and started to realize what it involved, the whole idea began to feel uncomfortable. Being around Ethan only made it worse.\n\nEthan didn't seem happy about it either. In fact, he often acted cold and oddly hostile--especially when she spent time with the boy next door.\n\nHis words were sharp, like he knew exactly how to get under her skin.\n\nTheir arguments got worse over time, going from childhood teasing to real, heated fights. They eventually couldn't stand each other.\n\nBy high school, Noelle had hit a rebellious streak. She marched right up to Jeffery one day and said she wanted to call off the arrangement--because she'd fallen for a boy in her class.\n\nWhen Ethan found out, he stormed into her room that night, looking like he'd walked straight out of a thunderstorm. His voice was ice-cold as he asked her if she'd completely lost her mind.\n\nShe'd never seen him so angry. They argued. Loudly. Painfully. And it all came crashing down that night.\n\nAfter that fight, Ethan left for school abroad, and she hadn't seen him since.\n\nShe hadn't even recognized him when she got into the car.\n\nHe'd changed so much. The boy she once knew was long gone.\n\nChapter 4 Get Married Today\nThe cityscape outside the window melted into streaks as the car sped along the road.\n\nNoelle noticed that Ethan hadn't touched the stack of documents beside him since she got into the car.\n\nInstead, his long fingers kept brushing gently against a faint scar on his left wrist. It looked almost like a b*te mark.\n\nNoticing her staring, Ethan spoke casually, a playful edge in his voice. \"A little wild kitten gave me that.\"\n\nNoelle blinked speechlessly.\n\nEthan lifted his brows slightly, like a memory had just surfaced. \"Short fuse, sharp tongue--real firecracker, that one.\"\n\nOnce again, she was speechless. A wild kitten? Short fuse? Sharp tongue?\n\nThat scar... it had to be from when they were kids. She remembered it clearly now--one of their silly childhood fights.\n\nIn a burst of frustration, she'd grabbed his wrist and sunk her teeth in. Hard.\n\nShe hadn't thought he'd remember it, let alone still have the mark.\n\nWhy hadn't he used scar cream or something? Why was the b*te mark still so clear? Did Ethan look at it and secretly hold a grudge against her every time he saw it?\n\nFeeling a mix of unease and confusion, Noelle rubbed the bridge of her nose and turned toward the window, pretending to admire the scenery.\n\nEthan said nothing more. He leaned back in his seat, eyes fixed on her side profile, his fingers tracing the scar again and again--like it meant more than just skin.\n\nThe air between them felt heavier now. Noelle squirmed a little, feeling his stare. She turned her head, ready to call him out on it.\n\nBut the moment their eyes met, she forgot what she was about to say.\n\nEthan raised his eyebrows slowly, his voice low and full of amusement. \"What's wrong, Noey? Thinking of b*ting me again?\"\n\nNoey.\n\nThe nickname rolled off his tongue so naturally, so smoothly. His tone was deep, almost lazy, but there was something in it that made her heartbeat skip.\n\nShe couldn't stop the memories from flooding back--Ethan had always called her that when they were kids.\n\nWait... What? Who was even thinking about biting him again?\n\nBefore she could respond, the car rolled to a stop in front of Scenery Estate--one of the Martin family's properties.\n\nThe tall wrought-iron gates creaked open slowly, and the car eased into the wide, perfectly manicured estate grounds.\n\nLooking out the window, Noelle took in the breathtaking view--a large, calm man-made lake shimmered nearby, surrounded by a bright, colorful garden overflowing with rare and exotic flowers.\n\nFarther out, a vineyard and an orchard stretched across the landscape.\n\nThe whole place was far more impressive than the Moss family's villa.\n\nThey stopped in front of a grand fountain.\n\nThere, waiting with a cane and surrounded by a few maids, stood an elderly man.\n\nHis silver hair was neatly combed, and though he leaned on his cane, his eyes sparkled with life and wisdom. Time had carved lines into his face, but it hadn't dulled his spirit.\n\nEven after all these years, Noelle knew him the moment she saw him. It was Levi.\n\nThe moment she got out of the car, Noelle rushed toward him, her eyes welling up with emotion. \"Levi, I've missed you so much!\"\n\n\"Noelle! My sweet girl!\" Levi's whole face lit up as he took her hand in his. His voice trembled with warmth. \"I've waited so long for this moment.\"\n\n\"How have you been, Levi? Are you feeling okay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Don't you go worrying about me now.\" He looked at her affectionately. \"This old body still works. But look at you--you've gotten thinner. Still beautiful, though. As lovely as ever.\"\n\nNoelle beamed, her smile soft and sincere. Her eyes curved like crescent moons, shining with a gentle light that made her look even more stunning.\n\nShe had always been beautiful, even as a child. Her features were delicate, the kind that looked painted on.\n\nBut it was her eyes--bright, clear, full of life--that were most attractive.\n\nLevi beamed as he looked at her, the joy in his eyes warm and genuine, like he was seeing his own granddaughter.\n\nHe passed his cane to a maid, and then gently took Noelle's hand in one of his and reached for Ethan's with the other. \"Come on, let's head inside and talk.\"\n\nInside the lavish living room, the three of them settled onto plush, velvety sofas.\n\nA maid appeared with a tray and quietly served coffee.\n\nLevi held on to Noelle's hand. He let out a deep sigh before speaking.\n\n\"My health hasn't been the best these past few years. I had to travel abroad for treatment, and it's been a slow road to recovery. I only just got well enough to return home. But the moment I got back, I heard things hadn't been good for you with the Moss family. I couldn't bear to hear that, so I asked Ethan to bring you here. If they can't treat you right, then forget them. From now on, this is your home. You're not alone. I'm your family.\"\n\nHis words hit her straight in the heart. They were so kind, so full of love, that Noelle felt her throat tighten. Her voice came out soft, thick with emotion. \"Levi...\"\n\n\"There, there.\" He gave her hand a gentle pat. \"You've had a tough time these past two years.\"\n\nThen, the mood shifted slightly. Levi gave her a knowing smile and nodded toward Ethan.\n\n\"You remember Ethan, don't you? You two were always together when you were little. You were really close back then.\"\n\nOf course she remembered.\n\nNoelle nodded politely, offering a small smile.\n\nEthan, sitting beside her, looked completely at ease.\n\nHis face gave nothing away--calm, composed, unreadable.\n\nWithout a word, he picked up the coffee pot and poured a cup for Levi smoothly, making even something as ordinary as pouring coffee seem elegant.\n\nLevi's eyes twinkled with mischief as he asked casually, \"So, what do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nThe question caught her off guard. What did she think of Ethan? To be honest, they hadn't exchanged many words on the ride over.\n\nAnd from the way he acted, it seemed like he still held onto whatever past grudge they had. She didn't really like him, and she was pretty sure the feeling was mutual.\n\nStill, Levi wouldn't let it go. \"Come on, sweetheart, tell me. What do you think of Ethan?\"\n\nNoelle sighed quietly and looked down, mumbling, \"He's... fine.\"\n\nEthan's expression didn't change much, but one of his eyebrows rose slightly.\n\nThen, slowly, he turned his head and looked at her. His gaze lingered just long enough before he looked away again.\n\nLevi's face, however, lit up. \"Perfect! That's all I needed to hear. Now I can rest easy.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, puzzled. \"Levi... what do you mean?\"\n\nLaughing warmly, Levi said, \"Years ago, Jeffery and I agreed on getting the two of you to get married. And seeing you now, I must say, you're still a perfect match. Tell you what, Noey--no better time than now. Why don't you and Ethan go ahead and get your marriage registered today?\"\n\nHer jaw nearly dropped. She was shocked and said in protest, \"Levi, that's way too sudden!\"\n\nLevi's face turned serious, and suddenly, he looked a little older.\n\n\"Noey... my health's failing. I don't know how much time I have left. But if I could see you and Ethan settled, it would put my heart at ease. Don't worry, child. The Martin family will always protect you. Ethan will always be your support.\"\n\nNoelle didn't know what to say. The love in Levi's voice was undeniable, and she didn't want to hurt him.\n\nShe instinctively turned to Ethan, silently begging him with her eyes to turn this down.\n\nSurely he didn't want this either. They didn't even get along. He'd always been oddly distant with her--annoyed, even. No way he'd agree.\n\nBut then Ethan placed his cup down quietly and looked straight at Levi. His face was calm, firm.\n\n\"All right, Grandpa. We'll go register it today.\"\n\nNoelle stared at him, stunned.\n\n......\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAvailable chapters here are limited, click the button below to install the App and enjoy more exciting chapters\n(Automatically jump to this novel when you open the app)\n\n&3&\n0:00 / 0:24",
