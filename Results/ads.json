        "primary_text": "💋 He was her ex-husband’s brother.\nAnd he just pulled her into his lap.\nHe was the one with power.\nThe one her ex bowed down to.\nAnd now,\nhe’s kissing her neck and whispering,\n“You should’ve been mine from the start.”\n--------------------------------------------------------\n##1.Chapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\n\n##2.Chapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n\n---\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\n\n##3.Chapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n\n---\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\n\n##4.Chapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n\n##5.Chapter 5 Reid's Downstairs\nBefore Yvonne could finish speaking, a fierce gleam flashed in Reid's eyes. Like a wild animal finally breaking free from its cage, he couldn't hold back any longer. He lowered his head, his face set with a reckless determination, and kissed Yvonne hard.\nThe sudden kiss left Yvonne's mind completely blank. Her first instinct was to pull away, but Reid's grip was like a vise, holding her tightly and leaving her unable to move.\nHis kiss was passionate and forceful, carrying an intensity that was impossible to resist. He parted her lips, exploring her mouth with a burning hunger.\nYvonne could feel his eagerness and longing—an emotion that had been bottled up for far too long. Gradually, her body went limp in his arms, and a strange, thrilling sensation spread through her.\nIt was a new kind of desire, one that made her heart race and her mind spin. Without realizing it, she began to kiss him back.\nReid shivered, wrapping his arm firmly around her waist, as if trying to merge with her. Half-carrying Yvonne, he strode toward the bedroom. The bedroom curtains were drawn tight, letting in just a sliver of moonlight. Reid kicked open the door with a dull thud.\nHe carried Yvonne to the bed and gently laid her on the soft mattress. Her hair spread out like a ribbon of silk on the white sheets, making her look incredibly inviting.\nReid hovered over her, his breath hot and heavy, as if he was about to devour her whole.\nHis fingers traced along her collarbone, trembling slightly—part reverence, part possession. The desire in his eyes was so deep it could drown a person, yet he still clung to the last thread of self-control.\n“Can I?” he asked, his voice low and hoarse.\n“Do it,” she whispered, eyes shut, breath uneven. “Just don’t make me regret it.”\nThat was all it took—his restraint snapped.\nHis lips and tongue descended on her neck, her collarbone, her chest, feverish and wild, like a beast finally unchained. He kissed her with reckless hunger, claiming every inch of her burning skin. His body pressed tightly against hers, hard and hot, his need barely contained even through the layers of fabric.\nShe tilted her head back, gasping softly, her whole body shivering under his mouth.\nThen he tore her clothes from her body with near-brutal urgency, stripping her bare beneath the moonlight and the fire in his eyes. Her skin trembled with need, and he looked down at her like she was everything he’d ever wanted.\nWith a guttural groan, Reid yanked off the last of his clothes. He positioned himself between her thighs, grinding against her slick warmth, the head of his cock dragging over her most sensitive spot—hot, thick, and pulsing with restraint on the edge.\n“Let me in,” he rasped, voice nearly broken. “I can’t wait anymore.”\nShe lifted her leg, wrapped it around his waist, and pulled him toward her.\nIn the next breath, he thrust into her—hard, deep, claiming.\nShe arched violently beneath him, her cry caught between pain and overwhelming pleasure. That fullness, that pressure, that long-awaited invasion made her moan aloud, helpless.\nReid moved like a man possessed—his rhythm relentless, heavy, every thrust sending a jolt straight through her spine. Yet even in his frenzy, he kissed her—on the mouth, her neck, her breast—as if he couldn’t bear a single inch of her to go untouched.\nSweat rolled down his back, dripping onto her heaving chest, mixing with her heat, their bodies slick and scorching.\nShe clung to him, her nails clawing into the muscles of his back, her moans growing louder with each thrust. He was driving her mad—pushing her, pounding her, unraveling her completely.\n“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted you,” he growled into her ear. “Since the first damn day I saw you, I’ve wanted to pin you down and make you beg me not to stop.”\nShe cried out—not from pain, but from sheer, raw pleasure. The way he needed her... it undid her.\n“Harder,” she pleaded, her voice broken and hoarse.\nAnd he gave it to her—his pace brutal, desperate, like he was pouring years of jealousy, restraint, and hunger into her body.\nThe room was filled with the sound of panting breaths, flesh against flesh, the bed creaking under the force of their union. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and lust.\nShe lost herself in his arms, climaxing again and again, until she didn’t know where she ended and he began. There was only Reid. Only him. His body. His voice. His love.\nWhen he finally buried himself deep inside her and groaned out his release, they both collapsed, trembling and wrecked, into each other’s arms.\n“This changes everything,” he murmured.\nAnd in that moment, Yvonne knew he was right.\nThe room seemed to grow warmer, with a romantic vibe filling every corner. Moonlight peeked through the curtain gaps, highlighting their entwined figures in a charming and fascinating scene.\n\n---\nYvonne woke early with Reid's arm around her waist and his gentle breaths against her neck. The warmth stirred mixed emotions in her heart. He had finally settled down at dawn and was now sleeping deeply, a slight smile on his lips.\nReid was undeniably handsome, with features finely sculpted like a statue—deep eyes, a high nose, and slightly pursed lips that exuded an irresistible charm. The Simmons family was one of the top-tier families in Avaloria. Approaching thirty, Reid had never been involved in any scandals.\nBefore Yvonne met him, people around Steven had mentioned that Reid might be gay. Last night, she had personally confirmed that Reid was not only straight but also very much the opposite.\nAs she thought about it, a slight blush appeared on her cheeks. She gently got up, moving carefully to avoid waking the man behind her.\nShe bent down to pick up the clothes scattered all over the floor, pausing when she saw the black stockings from last night. They were torn into pieces, reminding her of his wild actions.\nShe threw the stockings in the trash and quietly slipped out, carrying her clothes.\n\n---\nWhen Yvonne got home, Steven hadn't returned yet. After she took a shower, Iona, who had just woken up, was sitting in the living room drinking water. As soon as she saw Yvonne, she said, \"What time is it? Why haven't you made breakfast yet?\"\nWithout a word, Yvonne went into the kitchen to make cereal, but only enough for herself.\nWhen she came out with the cereal, Iona asked, \"Where's Steven? Still in bed?\"\n\"He left last night,\" Yvonne said simply.\nIona paused, clicked her tongue, and looked Yvonne up and down with disdain. \"Can't even handle your own man. Worthless.\"\nIona looked at the cereal in her hand and snorted, \"No wonder he doesn't want to eat this plain stuff. I'm not eating it either; it doesn't look appetizing at all.\"\nWith that, she got up and called a friend she hadn't known for long. \"Let's gather for a game night. I won 3 thousand yesterday. Let's keep it going today. Nobody's allowed to ditch.\"\nYvonne sat at the dining table, lowered her head, and took a spoonful of cereal. The taste was mild, not very filling.\nBut when one was at their weakest and hungriest, a big meal would be too much, while a simple bowl of cereal could nourish the body.\nShe was eating while scrolling through her phone. She saw that a post about Sharon's alleged prostitution had climbed to the top of Sharon's school's online page early in the morning. The post had pictures and seemed convincing, thrusting Sharon into the spotlight.\nSharon argued that the man was her boyfriend and wanted Steven to step in and solve it. But Yvonne knew Steven was busy making the company go public, and with the post gaining traction, there was no way he'd expose himself.\nSharon couldn't explain herself and had to silently bear the blame. With everyone gossiping, she went through a round of online shaming, no matter what the real story was.\nJust then, a message alert sounded from Yvonne's phone. [Ms. Stark, does the plan continue?]\nYvonne chuckled softly and replied, [Yeah.]\nAfter seeing the \"read\" notification, she erased the message and thought to herself, 'Great. Everything is going according to plan.'\nIn the afternoon, Yvonne went back to her matrimonial home. As she opened the door, the faint smell of disinfectant filled the room. She wrinkled her nose slightly and then opened all the windows and doors.\nShe then returned to her bedroom, glanced at the calendar, and started sorting out her belongings.\nWhen Steven returned, he immediately noticed a cardboard box at her feet, and his heart skipped a beat. \"What's this? Planning to run away?\"\nYvonne looked up at the man who now seemed like a stranger, sneering inwardly, 'After a trip to the police station, he's now pretending to be all gentlemanly.'\n\"No, just sorting through some of my old stuff,\" she replied, her voice calm and indifferent.\nSteven's gaze fell on a photo album in her hands from when they were young, and he felt a little relieved.\nYvonne loved collecting photos, meaningful or not; she liked having them printed and put into albums. She once said that photos on the phone lacked the real-time feel and only physical albums held truly special memories.\nSteven's expression softened, his eyes becoming more gentle. \"I'm just back to change clothes. I've got an event tonight; wait for me to come back.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, her eyes showing no emotion, as though she hadn't heard a word he said.\nSteven took off his shirt, and Yvonne saw the various hickies on him and lowered her eyes.\nSteven seemed to realize something wasn't right, so he put his shirt back on and walked toward the bathroom. At the door, he suddenly stopped and turned around to say, \"Oh, I forgot. Reid's downstairs. Can you go entertain him?\"\nYvonne was startled, stopped for a moment, then closed the photo album and went downstairs.\nReid stood in the living room, sunlight outlining his tall, strong figure. He held a photo frame with a picture of Yvonne and Steven. Yvonne watched him from the bottom step.\nReid heard a sound, placed the frame face down on the table, and looked up. His eyes were a bit narrow, now filled with a deep, mysterious light, like a sky full of stars.\nHis gaze seemed to see through everything, landing right on Yvonne and making her heart skip a beat. \"What do you want to drink?\" Yvonne asked.\n\"Something sour,\" Reid said with a teasing tone.\nYvonne paused, shot him a look, then opened the fridge, took out a bottle of lemonade, and handed it to him.\nReid was momentarily stunned, squinted his eyes a bit, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. As he reached out to get the drink, he suddenly pulled her arm, drawing her into his arms, and they both fell back onto the sofa.\n\"Are you crazy? Let me go,\" Yvonne whispered sharply.\nReid held her close, leaned in, and whispered slowly in her ear, \"Yvonne, you really think you can just leave after sharing a bed, huh? Planning to act like nothing happened?\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click “learn more” to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)\n0:00 / 0:27",

Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\n\n##2.Chapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n\n---\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\n\n##3.Chapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n\n---\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\n\n##4.Chapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n\n##5.Chapter 5 Reid's Downstairs\nBefore Yvonne could finish speaking, a fierce gleam flashed in Reid's eyes. Like a wild animal finally breaking free from its cage, he couldn't hold back any longer. He lowered his head, his face set with a reckless determination, and kissed Yvonne hard.\nThe sudden kiss left Yvonne's mind completely blank. Her first instinct was to pull away, but Reid's grip was like a vise, holding her tightly and leaving her unable to move.\nHis kiss was passionate and forceful, carrying an intensity that was impossible to resist. He parted her lips, exploring her mouth with a burning hunger.\nYvonne could feel his eagerness and longing—an emotion that had been bottled up for far too long. Gradually, her body went limp in his arms, and a strange, thrilling sensation spread through her.\nIt was a new kind of desire, one that made her heart race and her mind spin. Without realizing it, she began to kiss him back.\nReid shivered, wrapping his arm firmly around her waist, as if trying to merge with her. Half-carrying Yvonne, he strode toward the bedroom. The bedroom curtains were drawn tight, letting in just a sliver of moonlight. Reid kicked open the door with a dull thud.\nHe carried Yvonne to the bed and gently laid her on the soft mattress. Her hair spread out like a ribbon of silk on the white sheets, making her look incredibly inviting.\nReid hovered over her, his breath hot and heavy, as if he was about to devour her whole.\nHis fingers traced along her collarbone, trembling slightly—part reverence, part possession. The desire in his eyes was so deep it could drown a person, yet he still clung to the last thread of self-control.\n“Can I?” he asked, his voice low and hoarse.\n“Do it,” she whispered, eyes shut, breath uneven. “Just don’t make me regret it.”\nThat was all it took—his restraint snapped.\nHis lips and tongue descended on her neck, her collarbone, her chest, feverish and wild, like a beast finally unchained. He kissed her with reckless hunger, claiming every inch of her burning skin. His body pressed tightly against hers, hard and hot, his need barely contained even through the layers of fabric.\nShe tilted her head back, gasping softly, her whole body shivering under his mouth.\nThen he tore her clothes from her body with near-brutal urgency, stripping her bare beneath the moonlight and the fire in his eyes. Her skin trembled with need, and he looked down at her like she was everything he’d ever wanted.\nWith a guttural groan, Reid yanked off the last of his clothes. He positioned himself between her thighs, grinding against her slick warmth, the head of his cock dragging over her most sensitive spot—hot, thick, and pulsing with restraint on the edge.\n“Let me in,” he rasped, voice nearly broken. “I can’t wait anymore.”\nShe lifted her leg, wrapped it around his waist, and pulled him toward her.\nIn the next breath, he thrust into her—hard, deep, claiming.\nShe arched violently beneath him, her cry caught between pain and overwhelming pleasure. That fullness, that pressure, that long-awaited invasion made her moan aloud, helpless.\nReid moved like a man possessed—his rhythm relentless, heavy, every thrust sending a jolt straight through her spine. Yet even in his frenzy, he kissed her—on the mouth, her neck, her breast—as if he couldn’t bear a single inch of her to go untouched.\nSweat rolled down his back, dripping onto her heaving chest, mixing with her heat, their bodies slick and scorching.\nShe clung to him, her nails clawing into the muscles of his back, her moans growing louder with each thrust. He was driving her mad—pushing her, pounding her, unraveling her completely.\n“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted you,” he growled into her ear. “Since the first damn day I saw you, I’ve wanted to pin you down and make you beg me not to stop.”\nShe cried out—not from pain, but from sheer, raw pleasure. The way he needed her... it undid her.\n“Harder,” she pleaded, her voice broken and hoarse.\nAnd he gave it to her—his pace brutal, desperate, like he was pouring years of jealousy, restraint, and hunger into her body.\nThe room was filled with the sound of panting breaths, flesh against flesh, the bed creaking under the force of their union. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and lust.\nShe lost herself in his arms, climaxing again and again, until she didn’t know where she ended and he began. There was only Reid. Only him. His body. His voice. His love.\nWhen he finally buried himself deep inside her and groaned out his release, they both collapsed, trembling and wrecked, into each other’s arms.\n“This changes everything,” he murmured.\nAnd in that moment, Yvonne knew he was right.\nThe room seemed to grow warmer, with a romantic vibe filling every corner. Moonlight peeked through the curtain gaps, highlighting their entwined figures in a charming and fascinating scene.\n\n---\nYvonne woke early with Reid's arm around her waist and his gentle breaths against her neck. The warmth stirred mixed emotions in her heart. He had finally settled down at dawn and was now sleeping deeply, a slight smile on his lips.\nReid was undeniably handsome, with features finely sculpted like a statue—deep eyes, a high nose, and slightly pursed lips that exuded an irresistible charm. The Simmons family was one of the top-tier families in Avaloria. Approaching thirty, Reid had never been involved in any scandals.\nBefore Yvonne met him, people around Steven had mentioned that Reid might be gay. Last night, she had personally confirmed that Reid was not only straight but also very much the opposite.\nAs she thought about it, a slight blush appeared on her cheeks. She gently got up, moving carefully to avoid waking the man behind her.\nShe bent down to pick up the clothes scattered all over the floor, pausing when she saw the black stockings from last night. They were torn into pieces, reminding her of his wild actions.\nShe threw the stockings in the trash and quietly slipped out, carrying her clothes.\n\n---\nWhen Yvonne got home, Steven hadn't returned yet. After she took a shower, Iona, who had just woken up, was sitting in the living room drinking water. As soon as she saw Yvonne, she said, \"What time is it? Why haven't you made breakfast yet?\"\nWithout a word, Yvonne went into the kitchen to make cereal, but only enough for herself.\nWhen she came out with the cereal, Iona asked, \"Where's Steven? Still in bed?\"\n\"He left last night,\" Yvonne said simply.\nIona paused, clicked her tongue, and looked Yvonne up and down with disdain. \"Can't even handle your own man. Worthless.\"\nIona looked at the cereal in her hand and snorted, \"No wonder he doesn't want to eat this plain stuff. I'm not eating it either; it doesn't look appetizing at all.\"\nWith that, she got up and called a friend she hadn't known for long. \"Let's gather for a game night. I won 3 thousand yesterday. Let's keep it going today. Nobody's allowed to ditch.\"\nYvonne sat at the dining table, lowered her head, and took a spoonful of cereal. The taste was mild, not very filling.\nBut when one was at their weakest and hungriest, a big meal would be too much, while a simple bowl of cereal could nourish the body.\nShe was eating while scrolling through her phone. She saw that a post about Sharon's alleged prostitution had climbed to the top of Sharon's school's online page early in the morning. The post had pictures and seemed convincing, thrusting Sharon into the spotlight.\nSharon argued that the man was her boyfriend and wanted Steven to step in and solve it. But Yvonne knew Steven was busy making the company go public, and with the post gaining traction, there was no way he'd expose himself.\nSharon couldn't explain herself and had to silently bear the blame. With everyone gossiping, she went through a round of online shaming, no matter what the real story was.\nJust then, a message alert sounded from Yvonne's phone. [Ms. Stark, does the plan continue?]\nYvonne chuckled softly and replied, [Yeah.]\nAfter seeing the \"read\" notification, she erased the message and thought to herself, 'Great. Everything is going according to plan.'\nIn the afternoon, Yvonne went back to her matrimonial home. As she opened the door, the faint smell of disinfectant filled the room. She wrinkled her nose slightly and then opened all the windows and doors.\nShe then returned to her bedroom, glanced at the calendar, and started sorting out her belongings.\nWhen Steven returned, he immediately noticed a cardboard box at her feet, and his heart skipped a beat. \"What's this? Planning to run away?\"\nYvonne looked up at the man who now seemed like a stranger, sneering inwardly, 'After a trip to the police station, he's now pretending to be all gentlemanly.'\n\"No, just sorting through some of my old stuff,\" she replied, her voice calm and indifferent.\nSteven's gaze fell on a photo album in her hands from when they were young, and he felt a little relieved.\nYvonne loved collecting photos, meaningful or not; she liked having them printed and put into albums. She once said that photos on the phone lacked the real-time feel and only physical albums held truly special memories.\nSteven's expression softened, his eyes becoming more gentle. \"I'm just back to change clothes. I've got an event tonight; wait for me to come back.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, her eyes showing no emotion, as though she hadn't heard a word he said.\nSteven took off his shirt, and Yvonne saw the various hickies on him and lowered her eyes.\nSteven seemed to realize something wasn't right, so he put his shirt back on and walked toward the bathroom. At the door, he suddenly stopped and turned around to say, \"Oh, I forgot. Reid's downstairs. Can you go entertain him?\"\nYvonne was startled, stopped for a moment, then closed the photo album and went downstairs.\nReid stood in the living room, sunlight outlining his tall, strong figure. He held a photo frame with a picture of Yvonne and Steven. Yvonne watched him from the bottom step.\nReid heard a sound, placed the frame face down on the table, and looked up. His eyes were a bit narrow, now filled with a deep, mysterious light, like a sky full of stars.\nHis gaze seemed to see through everything, landing right on Yvonne and making her heart skip a beat. \"What do you want to drink?\" Yvonne asked.\n\"Something sour,\" Reid said with a teasing tone.\nYvonne paused, shot him a look, then opened the fridge, took out a bottle of lemonade, and handed it to him.\nReid was momentarily stunned, squinted his eyes a bit, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. As he reached out to get the drink, he suddenly pulled her arm, drawing her into his arms, and they both fell back onto the sofa.\n\"Are you crazy? Let me go,\" Yvonne whispered sharply.\nReid held her close, leaned in, and whispered slowly in her ear, \"Yvonne, you really think you can just leave after sharing a bed, huh? Planning to act like nothing happened?\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------- \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click “learn more” to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)\n0:00 / 0:27\nWEBSITE.LITERIESS.COM\n🔞Click to Read the Full Story👉\nLearn more"

Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\n\n##2.Chapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n\n---\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\n\n##3.Chapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n\n---\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\n\n##4.Chapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n\n##5.Chapter 5 Reid's Downstairs\nBefore Yvonne could finish speaking, a fierce gleam flashed in Reid's eyes. Like a wild animal finally breaking free from its cage, he couldn't hold back any longer. He lowered his head, his face set with a reckless determination, and kissed Yvonne hard.\nThe sudden kiss left Yvonne's mind completely blank. Her first instinct was to pull away, but Reid's grip was like a vise, holding her tightly and leaving her unable to move.\nHis kiss was passionate and forceful, carrying an intensity that was impossible to resist. He parted her lips, exploring her mouth with a burning hunger.\nYvonne could feel his eagerness and longing—an emotion that had been bottled up for far too long. Gradually, her body went limp in his arms, and a strange, thrilling sensation spread through her.\nIt was a new kind of desire, one that made her heart race and her mind spin. Without realizing it, she began to kiss him back.\nReid shivered, wrapping his arm firmly around her waist, as if trying to merge with her. Half-carrying Yvonne, he strode toward the bedroom. The bedroom curtains were drawn tight, letting in just a sliver of moonlight. Reid kicked open the door with a dull thud.\nHe carried Yvonne to the bed and gently laid her on the soft mattress. Her hair spread out like a ribbon of silk on the white sheets, making her look incredibly inviting.\nReid hovered over her, his breath hot and heavy, as if he was about to devour her whole.\nHis fingers traced along her collarbone, trembling slightly—part reverence, part possession. The desire in his eyes was so deep it could drown a person, yet he still clung to the last thread of self-control.\n“Can I?” he asked, his voice low and hoarse.\n“Do it,” she whispered, eyes shut, breath uneven. “Just don’t make me regret it.”\nThat was all it took—his restraint snapped.\nHis lips and tongue descended on her neck, her collarbone, her chest, feverish and wild, like a beast finally unchained. He kissed her with reckless hunger, claiming every inch of her burning skin. His body pressed tightly against hers, hard and hot, his need barely contained even through the layers of fabric.\nShe tilted her head back, gasping softly, her whole body shivering under his mouth.\nThen he tore her clothes from her body with near-brutal urgency, stripping her bare beneath the moonlight and the fire in his eyes. Her skin trembled with need, and he looked down at her like she was everything he’d ever wanted.\nWith a guttural groan, Reid yanked off the last of his clothes. He positioned himself between her thighs, grinding against her slick warmth, the head of his cock dragging over her most sensitive spot—hot, thick, and pulsing with restraint on the edge.\n“Let me in,” he rasped, voice nearly broken. “I can’t wait anymore.”\nShe lifted her leg, wrapped it around his waist, and pulled him toward her.\nIn the next breath, he thrust into her—hard, deep, claiming.\nShe arched violently beneath him, her cry caught between pain and overwhelming pleasure. That fullness, that pressure, that long-awaited invasion made her moan aloud, helpless.\nReid moved like a man possessed—his rhythm relentless, heavy, every thrust sending a jolt straight through her spine. Yet even in his frenzy, he kissed her—on the mouth, her neck, her breast—as if he couldn’t bear a single inch of her to go untouched.\nSweat rolled down his back, dripping onto her heaving chest, mixing with her heat, their bodies slick and scorching.\nShe clung to him, her nails clawing into the muscles of his back, her moans growing louder with each thrust. He was driving her mad—pushing her, pounding her, unraveling her completely.\n“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted you,” he growled into her ear. “Since the first damn day I saw you, I’ve wanted to pin you down and make you beg me not to stop.”\nShe cried out—not from pain, but from sheer, raw pleasure. The way he needed her... it undid her.\n“Harder,” she pleaded, her voice broken and hoarse.\nAnd he gave it to her—his pace brutal, desperate, like he was pouring years of jealousy, restraint, and hunger into her body.\nThe room was filled with the sound of panting breaths, flesh against flesh, the bed creaking under the force of their union. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and lust.\nShe lost herself in his arms, climaxing again and again, until she didn’t know where she ended and he began. There was only Reid. Only him. His body. His voice. His love.\nWhen he finally buried himself deep inside her and groaned out his release, they both collapsed, trembling and wrecked, into each other’s arms.\n“This changes everything,” he murmured.\nAnd in that moment, Yvonne knew he was right.\nThe room seemed to grow warmer, with a romantic vibe filling every corner. Moonlight peeked through the curtain gaps, highlighting their entwined figures in a charming and fascinating scene.\n\n---\nYvonne woke early with Reid's arm around her waist and his gentle breaths against her neck. The warmth stirred mixed emotions in her heart. He had finally settled down at dawn and was now sleeping deeply, a slight smile on his lips.\nReid was undeniably handsome, with features finely sculpted like a statue—deep eyes, a high nose, and slightly pursed lips that exuded an irresistible charm. The Simmons family was one of the top-tier families in Avaloria. Approaching thirty, Reid had never been involved in any scandals.\nBefore Yvonne met him, people around Steven had mentioned that Reid might be gay. Last night, she had personally confirmed that Reid was not only straight but also very much the opposite.\nAs she thought about it, a slight blush appeared on her cheeks. She gently got up, moving carefully to avoid waking the man behind her.\nShe bent down to pick up the clothes scattered all over the floor, pausing when she saw the black stockings from last night. They were torn into pieces, reminding her of his wild actions.\nShe threw the stockings in the trash and quietly slipped out, carrying her clothes.\n\n---\nWhen Yvonne got home, Steven hadn't returned yet. After she took a shower, Iona, who had just woken up, was sitting in the living room drinking water. As soon as she saw Yvonne, she said, \"What time is it? Why haven't you made breakfast yet?\"\nWithout a word, Yvonne went into the kitchen to make cereal, but only enough for herself.\nWhen she came out with the cereal, Iona asked, \"Where's Steven? Still in bed?\"\n\"He left last night,\" Yvonne said simply.\nIona paused, clicked her tongue, and looked Yvonne up and down with disdain. \"Can't even handle your own man. Worthless.\"\nIona looked at the cereal in her hand and snorted, \"No wonder he doesn't want to eat this plain stuff. I'm not eating it either; it doesn't look appetizing at all.\"\nWith that, she got up and called a friend she hadn't known for long. \"Let's gather for a game night. I won 3 thousand yesterday. Let's keep it going today. Nobody's allowed to ditch.\"\nYvonne sat at the dining table, lowered her head, and took a spoonful of cereal. The taste was mild, not very filling.\nBut when one was at their weakest and hungriest, a big meal would be too much, while a simple bowl of cereal could nourish the body.\nShe was eating while scrolling through her phone. She saw that a post about Sharon's alleged prostitution had climbed to the top of Sharon's school's online page early in the morning. The post had pictures and seemed convincing, thrusting Sharon into the spotlight.\nSharon argued that the man was her boyfriend and wanted Steven to step in and solve it. But Yvonne knew Steven was busy making the company go public, and with the post gaining traction, there was no way he'd expose himself.\nSharon couldn't explain herself and had to silently bear the blame. With everyone gossiping, she went through a round of online shaming, no matter what the real story was.\nJust then, a message alert sounded from Yvonne's phone. [Ms. Stark, does the plan continue?]\nYvonne chuckled softly and replied, [Yeah.]\nAfter seeing the \"read\" notification, she erased the message and thought to herself, 'Great. Everything is going according to plan.'\nIn the afternoon, Yvonne went back to her matrimonial home. As she opened the door, the faint smell of disinfectant filled the room. She wrinkled her nose slightly and then opened all the windows and doors.\nShe then returned to her bedroom, glanced at the calendar, and started sorting out her belongings.\nWhen Steven returned, he immediately noticed a cardboard box at her feet, and his heart skipped a beat. \"What's this? Planning to run away?\"\nYvonne looked up at the man who now seemed like a stranger, sneering inwardly, 'After a trip to the police station, he's now pretending to be all gentlemanly.'\n\"No, just sorting through some of my old stuff,\" she replied, her voice calm and indifferent.\nSteven's gaze fell on a photo album in her hands from when they were young, and he felt a little relieved.\nYvonne loved collecting photos, meaningful or not; she liked having them printed and put into albums. She once said that photos on the phone lacked the real-time feel and only physical albums held truly special memories.\nSteven's expression softened, his eyes becoming more gentle. \"I'm just back to change clothes. I've got an event tonight; wait for me to come back.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, her eyes showing no emotion, as though she hadn't heard a word he said.\nSteven took off his shirt, and Yvonne saw the various hickies on him and lowered her eyes.\nSteven seemed to realize something wasn't right, so he put his shirt back on and walked toward the bathroom. At the door, he suddenly stopped and turned around to say, \"Oh, I forgot. Reid's downstairs. Can you go entertain him?\"\nYvonne was startled, stopped for a moment, then closed the photo album and went downstairs.\nReid stood in the living room, sunlight outlining his tall, strong figure. He held a photo frame with a picture of Yvonne and Steven. Yvonne watched him from the bottom step.\nReid heard a sound, placed the frame face down on the table, and looked up. His eyes were a bit narrow, now filled with a deep, mysterious light, like a sky full of stars.\nHis gaze seemed to see through everything, landing right on Yvonne and making her heart skip a beat. \"What do you want to drink?\" Yvonne asked.\n\"Something sour,\" Reid said with a teasing tone.\nYvonne paused, shot him a look, then opened the fridge, took out a bottle of lemonade, and handed it to him.\nReid was momentarily stunned, squinted his eyes a bit, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. As he reached out to get the drink, he suddenly pulled her arm, drawing her into his arms, and they both fell back onto the sofa.\n\"Are you crazy? Let me go,\" Yvonne whispered sharply.\nReid held her close, leaned in, and whispered slowly in her ear, \"Yvonne, you really think you can just leave after sharing a bed, huh? Planning to act like nothing happened?\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click “learn more” to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)\n0:00 / 0:27",

Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\n\n##2.Chapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n\n---\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\n\n##3.Chapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n\n---\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\n\n##4.Chapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n\n##5.Chapter 5 Reid's Downstairs\nBefore Yvonne could finish speaking, a fierce gleam flashed in Reid's eyes. Like a wild animal finally breaking free from its cage, he couldn't hold back any longer. He lowered his head, his face set with a reckless determination, and kissed Yvonne hard.\nThe sudden kiss left Yvonne's mind completely blank. Her first instinct was to pull away, but Reid's grip was like a vise, holding her tightly and leaving her unable to move.\nHis kiss was passionate and forceful, carrying an intensity that was impossible to resist. He parted her lips, exploring her mouth with a burning hunger.\nYvonne could feel his eagerness and longing—an emotion that had been bottled up for far too long. Gradually, her body went limp in his arms, and a strange, thrilling sensation spread through her.\nIt was a new kind of desire, one that made her heart race and her mind spin. Without realizing it, she began to kiss him back.\nReid shivered, wrapping his arm firmly around her waist, as if trying to merge with her. Half-carrying Yvonne, he strode toward the bedroom. The bedroom curtains were drawn tight, letting in just a sliver of moonlight. Reid kicked open the door with a dull thud.\nHe carried Yvonne to the bed and gently laid her on the soft mattress. Her hair spread out like a ribbon of silk on the white sheets, making her look incredibly inviting.\nReid hovered over her, his breath hot and heavy, as if he was about to devour her whole.\nHis fingers traced along her collarbone, trembling slightly—part reverence, part possession. The desire in his eyes was so deep it could drown a person, yet he still clung to the last thread of self-control.\n“Can I?” he asked, his voice low and hoarse.\n“Do it,” she whispered, eyes shut, breath uneven. “Just don’t make me regret it.”\nThat was all it took—his restraint snapped.\nHis lips and tongue descended on her neck, her collarbone, her chest, feverish and wild, like a beast finally unchained. He kissed her with reckless hunger, claiming every inch of her burning skin. His body pressed tightly against hers, hard and hot, his need barely contained even through the layers of fabric.\nShe tilted her head back, gasping softly, her whole body shivering under his mouth.\nThen he tore her clothes from her body with near-brutal urgency, stripping her bare beneath the moonlight and the fire in his eyes. Her skin trembled with need, and he looked down at her like she was everything he’d ever wanted.\nWith a guttural groan, Reid yanked off the last of his clothes. He positioned himself between her thighs, grinding against her slick warmth, the head of his cock dragging over her most sensitive spot—hot, thick, and pulsing with restraint on the edge.\n“Let me in,” he rasped, voice nearly broken. “I can’t wait anymore.”\nShe lifted her leg, wrapped it around his waist, and pulled him toward her.\nIn the next breath, he thrust into her—hard, deep, claiming.\nShe arched violently beneath him, her cry caught between pain and overwhelming pleasure. That fullness, that pressure, that long-awaited invasion made her moan aloud, helpless.\nReid moved like a man possessed—his rhythm relentless, heavy, every thrust sending a jolt straight through her spine. Yet even in his frenzy, he kissed her—on the mouth, her neck, her breast—as if he couldn’t bear a single inch of her to go untouched.\nSweat rolled down his back, dripping onto her heaving chest, mixing with her heat, their bodies slick and scorching.\nShe clung to him, her nails clawing into the muscles of his back, her moans growing louder with each thrust. He was driving her mad—pushing her, pounding her, unraveling her completely.\n“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted you,” he growled into her ear. “Since the first damn day I saw you, I’ve wanted to pin you down and make you beg me not to stop.”\nShe cried out—not from pain, but from sheer, raw pleasure. The way he needed her... it undid her.\n“Harder,” she pleaded, her voice broken and hoarse.\nAnd he gave it to her—his pace brutal, desperate, like he was pouring years of jealousy, restraint, and hunger into her body.\nThe room was filled with the sound of panting breaths, flesh against flesh, the bed creaking under the force of their union. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and lust.\nShe lost herself in his arms, climaxing again and again, until she didn’t know where she ended and he began. There was only Reid. Only him. His body. His voice. His love.\nWhen he finally buried himself deep inside her and groaned out his release, they both collapsed, trembling and wrecked, into each other’s arms.\n“This changes everything,” he murmured.\nAnd in that moment, Yvonne knew he was right.\nThe room seemed to grow warmer, with a romantic vibe filling every corner. Moonlight peeked through the curtain gaps, highlighting their entwined figures in a charming and fascinating scene.\n\n---\nYvonne woke early with Reid's arm around her waist and his gentle breaths against her neck. The warmth stirred mixed emotions in her heart. He had finally settled down at dawn and was now sleeping deeply, a slight smile on his lips.\nReid was undeniably handsome, with features finely sculpted like a statue—deep eyes, a high nose, and slightly pursed lips that exuded an irresistible charm. The Simmons family was one of the top-tier families in Avaloria. Approaching thirty, Reid had never been involved in any scandals.\nBefore Yvonne met him, people around Steven had mentioned that Reid might be gay. Last night, she had personally confirmed that Reid was not only straight but also very much the opposite.\nAs she thought about it, a slight blush appeared on her cheeks. She gently got up, moving carefully to avoid waking the man behind her.\nShe bent down to pick up the clothes scattered all over the floor, pausing when she saw the black stockings from last night. They were torn into pieces, reminding her of his wild actions.\nShe threw the stockings in the trash and quietly slipped out, carrying her clothes.\n\n---\nWhen Yvonne got home, Steven hadn't returned yet. After she took a shower, Iona, who had just woken up, was sitting in the living room drinking water. As soon as she saw Yvonne, she said, \"What time is it? Why haven't you made breakfast yet?\"\nWithout a word, Yvonne went into the kitchen to make cereal, but only enough for herself.\nWhen she came out with the cereal, Iona asked, \"Where's Steven? Still in bed?\"\n\"He left last night,\" Yvonne said simply.\nIona paused, clicked her tongue, and looked Yvonne up and down with disdain. \"Can't even handle your own man. Worthless.\"\nIona looked at the cereal in her hand and snorted, \"No wonder he doesn't want to eat this plain stuff. I'm not eating it either; it doesn't look appetizing at all.\"\nWith that, she got up and called a friend she hadn't known for long. \"Let's gather for a game night. I won 3 thousand yesterday. Let's keep it going today. Nobody's allowed to ditch.\"\nYvonne sat at the dining table, lowered her head, and took a spoonful of cereal. The taste was mild, not very filling.\nBut when one was at their weakest and hungriest, a big meal would be too much, while a simple bowl of cereal could nourish the body.\nShe was eating while scrolling through her phone. She saw that a post about Sharon's alleged prostitution had climbed to the top of Sharon's school's online page early in the morning. The post had pictures and seemed convincing, thrusting Sharon into the spotlight.\nSharon argued that the man was her boyfriend and wanted Steven to step in and solve it. But Yvonne knew Steven was busy making the company go public, and with the post gaining traction, there was no way he'd expose himself.\nSharon couldn't explain herself and had to silently bear the blame. With everyone gossiping, she went through a round of online shaming, no matter what the real story was.\nJust then, a message alert sounded from Yvonne's phone. [Ms. Stark, does the plan continue?]\nYvonne chuckled softly and replied, [Yeah.]\nAfter seeing the \"read\" notification, she erased the message and thought to herself, 'Great. Everything is going according to plan.'\nIn the afternoon, Yvonne went back to her matrimonial home. As she opened the door, the faint smell of disinfectant filled the room. She wrinkled her nose slightly and then opened all the windows and doors.\nShe then returned to her bedroom, glanced at the calendar, and started sorting out her belongings.\nWhen Steven returned, he immediately noticed a cardboard box at her feet, and his heart skipped a beat. \"What's this? Planning to run away?\"\nYvonne looked up at the man who now seemed like a stranger, sneering inwardly, 'After a trip to the police station, he's now pretending to be all gentlemanly.'\n\"No, just sorting through some of my old stuff,\" she replied, her voice calm and indifferent.\nSteven's gaze fell on a photo album in her hands from when they were young, and he felt a little relieved.\nYvonne loved collecting photos, meaningful or not; she liked having them printed and put into albums. She once said that photos on the phone lacked the real-time feel and only physical albums held truly special memories.\nSteven's expression softened, his eyes becoming more gentle. \"I'm just back to change clothes. I've got an event tonight; wait for me to come back.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, her eyes showing no emotion, as though she hadn't heard a word he said.\nSteven took off his shirt, and Yvonne saw the various hickies on him and lowered her eyes.\nSteven seemed to realize something wasn't right, so he put his shirt back on and walked toward the bathroom. At the door, he suddenly stopped and turned around to say, \"Oh, I forgot. Reid's downstairs. Can you go entertain him?\"\nYvonne was startled, stopped for a moment, then closed the photo album and went downstairs.\nReid stood in the living room, sunlight outlining his tall, strong figure. He held a photo frame with a picture of Yvonne and Steven. Yvonne watched him from the bottom step.\nReid heard a sound, placed the frame face down on the table, and looked up. His eyes were a bit narrow, now filled with a deep, mysterious light, like a sky full of stars.\nHis gaze seemed to see through everything, landing right on Yvonne and making her heart skip a beat. \"What do you want to drink?\" Yvonne asked.\n\"Something sour,\" Reid said with a teasing tone.\nYvonne paused, shot him a look, then opened the fridge, took out a bottle of lemonade, and handed it to him.\nReid was momentarily stunned, squinted his eyes a bit, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. As he reached out to get the drink, he suddenly pulled her arm, drawing her into his arms, and they both fell back onto the sofa.\n\"Are you crazy? Let me go,\" Yvonne whispered sharply.\nReid held her close, leaned in, and whispered slowly in her ear, \"Yvonne, you really think you can just leave after sharing a bed, huh? Planning to act like nothing happened?\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------- \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click “learn more” to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)\n0:00 / 0:27\nWEBSITE.LITERIESS.COM\n🔞Click to Read the Full Story👉\nLearn more"

Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\n\n##2.Chapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n\n---\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\n\n##3.Chapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n\n---\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\n\n##4.Chapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n\n##5.Chapter 5 Reid's Downstairs\nBefore Yvonne could finish speaking, a fierce gleam flashed in Reid's eyes. Like a wild animal finally breaking free from its cage, he couldn't hold back any longer. He lowered his head, his face set with a reckless determination, and kissed Yvonne hard.\nThe sudden kiss left Yvonne's mind completely blank. Her first instinct was to pull away, but Reid's grip was like a vise, holding her tightly and leaving her unable to move.\nHis kiss was passionate and forceful, carrying an intensity that was impossible to resist. He parted her lips, exploring her mouth with a burning hunger.\nYvonne could feel his eagerness and longing—an emotion that had been bottled up for far too long. Gradually, her body went limp in his arms, and a strange, thrilling sensation spread through her.\nIt was a new kind of desire, one that made her heart race and her mind spin. Without realizing it, she began to kiss him back.\nReid shivered, wrapping his arm firmly around her waist, as if trying to merge with her. Half-carrying Yvonne, he strode toward the bedroom. The bedroom curtains were drawn tight, letting in just a sliver of moonlight. Reid kicked open the door with a dull thud.\nHe carried Yvonne to the bed and gently laid her on the soft mattress. Her hair spread out like a ribbon of silk on the white sheets, making her look incredibly inviting.\nReid hovered over her, his breath hot and heavy, as if he was about to devour her whole.\nHis fingers traced along her collarbone, trembling slightly—part reverence, part possession. The desire in his eyes was so deep it could drown a person, yet he still clung to the last thread of self-control.\n“Can I?” he asked, his voice low and hoarse.\n“Do it,” she whispered, eyes shut, breath uneven. “Just don’t make me regret it.”\nThat was all it took—his restraint snapped.\nHis lips and tongue descended on her neck, her collarbone, her chest, feverish and wild, like a beast finally unchained. He kissed her with reckless hunger, claiming every inch of her burning skin. His body pressed tightly against hers, hard and hot, his need barely contained even through the layers of fabric.\nShe tilted her head back, gasping softly, her whole body shivering under his mouth.\nThen he tore her clothes from her body with near-brutal urgency, stripping her bare beneath the moonlight and the fire in his eyes. Her skin trembled with need, and he looked down at her like she was everything he’d ever wanted.\nWith a guttural groan, Reid yanked off the last of his clothes. He positioned himself between her thighs, grinding against her slick warmth, the head of his cock dragging over her most sensitive spot—hot, thick, and pulsing with restraint on the edge.\n“Let me in,” he rasped, voice nearly broken. “I can’t wait anymore.”\nShe lifted her leg, wrapped it around his waist, and pulled him toward her.\nIn the next breath, he thrust into her—hard, deep, claiming.\nShe arched violently beneath him, her cry caught between pain and overwhelming pleasure. That fullness, that pressure, that long-awaited invasion made her moan aloud, helpless.\nReid moved like a man possessed—his rhythm relentless, heavy, every thrust sending a jolt straight through her spine. Yet even in his frenzy, he kissed her—on the mouth, her neck, her breast—as if he couldn’t bear a single inch of her to go untouched.\nSweat rolled down his back, dripping onto her heaving chest, mixing with her heat, their bodies slick and scorching.\nShe clung to him, her nails clawing into the muscles of his back, her moans growing louder with each thrust. He was driving her mad—pushing her, pounding her, unraveling her completely.\n“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted you,” he growled into her ear. “Since the first damn day I saw you, I’ve wanted to pin you down and make you beg me not to stop.”\nShe cried out—not from pain, but from sheer, raw pleasure. The way he needed her... it undid her.\n“Harder,” she pleaded, her voice broken and hoarse.\nAnd he gave it to her—his pace brutal, desperate, like he was pouring years of jealousy, restraint, and hunger into her body.\nThe room was filled with the sound of panting breaths, flesh against flesh, the bed creaking under the force of their union. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and lust.\nShe lost herself in his arms, climaxing again and again, until she didn’t know where she ended and he began. There was only Reid. Only him. His body. His voice. His love.\nWhen he finally buried himself deep inside her and groaned out his release, they both collapsed, trembling and wrecked, into each other’s arms.\n“This changes everything,” he murmured.\nAnd in that moment, Yvonne knew he was right.\nThe room seemed to grow warmer, with a romantic vibe filling every corner. Moonlight peeked through the curtain gaps, highlighting their entwined figures in a charming and fascinating scene.\n\n---\nYvonne woke early with Reid's arm around her waist and his gentle breaths against her neck. The warmth stirred mixed emotions in her heart. He had finally settled down at dawn and was now sleeping deeply, a slight smile on his lips.\nReid was undeniably handsome, with features finely sculpted like a statue—deep eyes, a high nose, and slightly pursed lips that exuded an irresistible charm. The Simmons family was one of the top-tier families in Avaloria. Approaching thirty, Reid had never been involved in any scandals.\nBefore Yvonne met him, people around Steven had mentioned that Reid might be gay. Last night, she had personally confirmed that Reid was not only straight but also very much the opposite.\nAs she thought about it, a slight blush appeared on her cheeks. She gently got up, moving carefully to avoid waking the man behind her.\nShe bent down to pick up the clothes scattered all over the floor, pausing when she saw the black stockings from last night. They were torn into pieces, reminding her of his wild actions.\nShe threw the stockings in the trash and quietly slipped out, carrying her clothes.\n\n---\nWhen Yvonne got home, Steven hadn't returned yet. After she took a shower, Iona, who had just woken up, was sitting in the living room drinking water. As soon as she saw Yvonne, she said, \"What time is it? Why haven't you made breakfast yet?\"\nWithout a word, Yvonne went into the kitchen to make cereal, but only enough for herself.\nWhen she came out with the cereal, Iona asked, \"Where's Steven? Still in bed?\"\n\"He left last night,\" Yvonne said simply.\nIona paused, clicked her tongue, and looked Yvonne up and down with disdain. \"Can't even handle your own man. Worthless.\"\nIona looked at the cereal in her hand and snorted, \"No wonder he doesn't want to eat this plain stuff. I'm not eating it either; it doesn't look appetizing at all.\"\nWith that, she got up and called a friend she hadn't known for long. \"Let's gather for a game night. I won 3 thousand yesterday. Let's keep it going today. Nobody's allowed to ditch.\"\nYvonne sat at the dining table, lowered her head, and took a spoonful of cereal. The taste was mild, not very filling.\nBut when one was at their weakest and hungriest, a big meal would be too much, while a simple bowl of cereal could nourish the body.\nShe was eating while scrolling through her phone. She saw that a post about Sharon's alleged prostitution had climbed to the top of Sharon's school's online page early in the morning. The post had pictures and seemed convincing, thrusting Sharon into the spotlight.\nSharon argued that the man was her boyfriend and wanted Steven to step in and solve it. But Yvonne knew Steven was busy making the company go public, and with the post gaining traction, there was no way he'd expose himself.\nSharon couldn't explain herself and had to silently bear the blame. With everyone gossiping, she went through a round of online shaming, no matter what the real story was.\nJust then, a message alert sounded from Yvonne's phone. [Ms. Stark, does the plan continue?]\nYvonne chuckled softly and replied, [Yeah.]\nAfter seeing the \"read\" notification, she erased the message and thought to herself, 'Great. Everything is going according to plan.'\nIn the afternoon, Yvonne went back to her matrimonial home. As she opened the door, the faint smell of disinfectant filled the room. She wrinkled her nose slightly and then opened all the windows and doors.\nShe then returned to her bedroom, glanced at the calendar, and started sorting out her belongings.\nWhen Steven returned, he immediately noticed a cardboard box at her feet, and his heart skipped a beat. \"What's this? Planning to run away?\"\nYvonne looked up at the man who now seemed like a stranger, sneering inwardly, 'After a trip to the police station, he's now pretending to be all gentlemanly.'\n\"No, just sorting through some of my old stuff,\" she replied, her voice calm and indifferent.\nSteven's gaze fell on a photo album in her hands from when they were young, and he felt a little relieved.\nYvonne loved collecting photos, meaningful or not; she liked having them printed and put into albums. She once said that photos on the phone lacked the real-time feel and only physical albums held truly special memories.\nSteven's expression softened, his eyes becoming more gentle. \"I'm just back to change clothes. I've got an event tonight; wait for me to come back.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, her eyes showing no emotion, as though she hadn't heard a word he said.\nSteven took off his shirt, and Yvonne saw the various hickies on him and lowered her eyes.\nSteven seemed to realize something wasn't right, so he put his shirt back on and walked toward the bathroom. At the door, he suddenly stopped and turned around to say, \"Oh, I forgot. Reid's downstairs. Can you go entertain him?\"\nYvonne was startled, stopped for a moment, then closed the photo album and went downstairs.\nReid stood in the living room, sunlight outlining his tall, strong figure. He held a photo frame with a picture of Yvonne and Steven. Yvonne watched him from the bottom step.\nReid heard a sound, placed the frame face down on the table, and looked up. His eyes were a bit narrow, now filled with a deep, mysterious light, like a sky full of stars.\nHis gaze seemed to see through everything, landing right on Yvonne and making her heart skip a beat. \"What do you want to drink?\" Yvonne asked.\n\"Something sour,\" Reid said with a teasing tone.\nYvonne paused, shot him a look, then opened the fridge, took out a bottle of lemonade, and handed it to him.\nReid was momentarily stunned, squinted his eyes a bit, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. As he reached out to get the drink, he suddenly pulled her arm, drawing her into his arms, and they both fell back onto the sofa.\n\"Are you crazy? Let me go,\" Yvonne whispered sharply.\nReid held her close, leaned in, and whispered slowly in her ear, \"Yvonne, you really think you can just leave after sharing a bed, huh? Planning to act like nothing happened?\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click “learn more” to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)\n0:00 / 0:16",

Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\n\n##2.Chapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n\n---\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\n\n##3.Chapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n\n---\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\n\n##4.Chapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n\n##5.Chapter 5 Reid's Downstairs\nBefore Yvonne could finish speaking, a fierce gleam flashed in Reid's eyes. Like a wild animal finally breaking free from its cage, he couldn't hold back any longer. He lowered his head, his face set with a reckless determination, and kissed Yvonne hard.\nThe sudden kiss left Yvonne's mind completely blank. Her first instinct was to pull away, but Reid's grip was like a vise, holding her tightly and leaving her unable to move.\nHis kiss was passionate and forceful, carrying an intensity that was impossible to resist. He parted her lips, exploring her mouth with a burning hunger.\nYvonne could feel his eagerness and longing—an emotion that had been bottled up for far too long. Gradually, her body went limp in his arms, and a strange, thrilling sensation spread through her.\nIt was a new kind of desire, one that made her heart race and her mind spin. Without realizing it, she began to kiss him back.\nReid shivered, wrapping his arm firmly around her waist, as if trying to merge with her. Half-carrying Yvonne, he strode toward the bedroom. The bedroom curtains were drawn tight, letting in just a sliver of moonlight. Reid kicked open the door with a dull thud.\nHe carried Yvonne to the bed and gently laid her on the soft mattress. Her hair spread out like a ribbon of silk on the white sheets, making her look incredibly inviting.\nReid hovered over her, his breath hot and heavy, as if he was about to devour her whole.\nHis fingers traced along her collarbone, trembling slightly—part reverence, part possession. The desire in his eyes was so deep it could drown a person, yet he still clung to the last thread of self-control.\n“Can I?” he asked, his voice low and hoarse.\n“Do it,” she whispered, eyes shut, breath uneven. “Just don’t make me regret it.”\nThat was all it took—his restraint snapped.\nHis lips and tongue descended on her neck, her collarbone, her chest, feverish and wild, like a beast finally unchained. He kissed her with reckless hunger, claiming every inch of her burning skin. His body pressed tightly against hers, hard and hot, his need barely contained even through the layers of fabric.\nShe tilted her head back, gasping softly, her whole body shivering under his mouth.\nThen he tore her clothes from her body with near-brutal urgency, stripping her bare beneath the moonlight and the fire in his eyes. Her skin trembled with need, and he looked down at her like she was everything he’d ever wanted.\nWith a guttural groan, Reid yanked off the last of his clothes. He positioned himself between her thighs, grinding against her slick warmth, the head of his cock dragging over her most sensitive spot—hot, thick, and pulsing with restraint on the edge.\n“Let me in,” he rasped, voice nearly broken. “I can’t wait anymore.”\nShe lifted her leg, wrapped it around his waist, and pulled him toward her.\nIn the next breath, he thrust into her—hard, deep, claiming.\nShe arched violently beneath him, her cry caught between pain and overwhelming pleasure. That fullness, that pressure, that long-awaited invasion made her moan aloud, helpless.\nReid moved like a man possessed—his rhythm relentless, heavy, every thrust sending a jolt straight through her spine. Yet even in his frenzy, he kissed her—on the mouth, her neck, her breast—as if he couldn’t bear a single inch of her to go untouched.\nSweat rolled down his back, dripping onto her heaving chest, mixing with her heat, their bodies slick and scorching.\nShe clung to him, her nails clawing into the muscles of his back, her moans growing louder with each thrust. He was driving her mad—pushing her, pounding her, unraveling her completely.\n“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted you,” he growled into her ear. “Since the first damn day I saw you, I’ve wanted to pin you down and make you beg me not to stop.”\nShe cried out—not from pain, but from sheer, raw pleasure. The way he needed her... it undid her.\n“Harder,” she pleaded, her voice broken and hoarse.\nAnd he gave it to her—his pace brutal, desperate, like he was pouring years of jealousy, restraint, and hunger into her body.\nThe room was filled with the sound of panting breaths, flesh against flesh, the bed creaking under the force of their union. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and lust.\nShe lost herself in his arms, climaxing again and again, until she didn’t know where she ended and he began. There was only Reid. Only him. His body. His voice. His love.\nWhen he finally buried himself deep inside her and groaned out his release, they both collapsed, trembling and wrecked, into each other’s arms.\n“This changes everything,” he murmured.\nAnd in that moment, Yvonne knew he was right.\nThe room seemed to grow warmer, with a romantic vibe filling every corner. Moonlight peeked through the curtain gaps, highlighting their entwined figures in a charming and fascinating scene.\n\n---\nYvonne woke early with Reid's arm around her waist and his gentle breaths against her neck. The warmth stirred mixed emotions in her heart. He had finally settled down at dawn and was now sleeping deeply, a slight smile on his lips.\nReid was undeniably handsome, with features finely sculpted like a statue—deep eyes, a high nose, and slightly pursed lips that exuded an irresistible charm. The Simmons family was one of the top-tier families in Avaloria. Approaching thirty, Reid had never been involved in any scandals.\nBefore Yvonne met him, people around Steven had mentioned that Reid might be gay. Last night, she had personally confirmed that Reid was not only straight but also very much the opposite.\nAs she thought about it, a slight blush appeared on her cheeks. She gently got up, moving carefully to avoid waking the man behind her.\nShe bent down to pick up the clothes scattered all over the floor, pausing when she saw the black stockings from last night. They were torn into pieces, reminding her of his wild actions.\nShe threw the stockings in the trash and quietly slipped out, carrying her clothes.\n\n---\nWhen Yvonne got home, Steven hadn't returned yet. After she took a shower, Iona, who had just woken up, was sitting in the living room drinking water. As soon as she saw Yvonne, she said, \"What time is it? Why haven't you made breakfast yet?\"\nWithout a word, Yvonne went into the kitchen to make cereal, but only enough for herself.\nWhen she came out with the cereal, Iona asked, \"Where's Steven? Still in bed?\"\n\"He left last night,\" Yvonne said simply.\nIona paused, clicked her tongue, and looked Yvonne up and down with disdain. \"Can't even handle your own man. Worthless.\"\nIona looked at the cereal in her hand and snorted, \"No wonder he doesn't want to eat this plain stuff. I'm not eating it either; it doesn't look appetizing at all.\"\nWith that, she got up and called a friend she hadn't known for long. \"Let's gather for a game night. I won 3 thousand yesterday. Let's keep it going today. Nobody's allowed to ditch.\"\nYvonne sat at the dining table, lowered her head, and took a spoonful of cereal. The taste was mild, not very filling.\nBut when one was at their weakest and hungriest, a big meal would be too much, while a simple bowl of cereal could nourish the body.\nShe was eating while scrolling through her phone. She saw that a post about Sharon's alleged prostitution had climbed to the top of Sharon's school's online page early in the morning. The post had pictures and seemed convincing, thrusting Sharon into the spotlight.\nSharon argued that the man was her boyfriend and wanted Steven to step in and solve it. But Yvonne knew Steven was busy making the company go public, and with the post gaining traction, there was no way he'd expose himself.\nSharon couldn't explain herself and had to silently bear the blame. With everyone gossiping, she went through a round of online shaming, no matter what the real story was.\nJust then, a message alert sounded from Yvonne's phone. [Ms. Stark, does the plan continue?]\nYvonne chuckled softly and replied, [Yeah.]\nAfter seeing the \"read\" notification, she erased the message and thought to herself, 'Great. Everything is going according to plan.'\nIn the afternoon, Yvonne went back to her matrimonial home. As she opened the door, the faint smell of disinfectant filled the room. She wrinkled her nose slightly and then opened all the windows and doors.\nShe then returned to her bedroom, glanced at the calendar, and started sorting out her belongings.\nWhen Steven returned, he immediately noticed a cardboard box at her feet, and his heart skipped a beat. \"What's this? Planning to run away?\"\nYvonne looked up at the man who now seemed like a stranger, sneering inwardly, 'After a trip to the police station, he's now pretending to be all gentlemanly.'\n\"No, just sorting through some of my old stuff,\" she replied, her voice calm and indifferent.\nSteven's gaze fell on a photo album in her hands from when they were young, and he felt a little relieved.\nYvonne loved collecting photos, meaningful or not; she liked having them printed and put into albums. She once said that photos on the phone lacked the real-time feel and only physical albums held truly special memories.\nSteven's expression softened, his eyes becoming more gentle. \"I'm just back to change clothes. I've got an event tonight; wait for me to come back.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, her eyes showing no emotion, as though she hadn't heard a word he said.\nSteven took off his shirt, and Yvonne saw the various hickies on him and lowered her eyes.\nSteven seemed to realize something wasn't right, so he put his shirt back on and walked toward the bathroom. At the door, he suddenly stopped and turned around to say, \"Oh, I forgot. Reid's downstairs. Can you go entertain him?\"\nYvonne was startled, stopped for a moment, then closed the photo album and went downstairs.\nReid stood in the living room, sunlight outlining his tall, strong figure. He held a photo frame with a picture of Yvonne and Steven. Yvonne watched him from the bottom step.\nReid heard a sound, placed the frame face down on the table, and looked up. His eyes were a bit narrow, now filled with a deep, mysterious light, like a sky full of stars.\nHis gaze seemed to see through everything, landing right on Yvonne and making her heart skip a beat. \"What do you want to drink?\" Yvonne asked.\n\"Something sour,\" Reid said with a teasing tone.\nYvonne paused, shot him a look, then opened the fridge, took out a bottle of lemonade, and handed it to him.\nReid was momentarily stunned, squinted his eyes a bit, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. As he reached out to get the drink, he suddenly pulled her arm, drawing her into his arms, and they both fell back onto the sofa.\n\"Are you crazy? Let me go,\" Yvonne whispered sharply.\nReid held her close, leaned in, and whispered slowly in her ear, \"Yvonne, you really think you can just leave after sharing a bed, huh? Planning to act like nothing happened?\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------- \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click “learn more” to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)\n0:00 / 0:16\nWEBSITE.LITERIESS.COM\n🔞Click to Read the Full Story👉\nLearn more"

Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\n\n##2.Chapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n\n---\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\n\n##3.Chapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n\n---\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\n\n##4.Chapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n\n##5.Chapter 5 Reid's Downstairs\nBefore Yvonne could finish speaking, a fierce gleam flashed in Reid's eyes. Like a wild animal finally breaking free from its cage, he couldn't hold back any longer. He lowered his head, his face set with a reckless determination, and kissed Yvonne hard.\nThe sudden kiss left Yvonne's mind completely blank. Her first instinct was to pull away, but Reid's grip was like a vise, holding her tightly and leaving her unable to move.\nHis kiss was passionate and forceful, carrying an intensity that was impossible to resist. He parted her lips, exploring her mouth with a burning hunger.\nYvonne could feel his eagerness and longing—an emotion that had been bottled up for far too long. Gradually, her body went limp in his arms, and a strange, thrilling sensation spread through her.\nIt was a new kind of desire, one that made her heart race and her mind spin. Without realizing it, she began to kiss him back.\nReid shivered, wrapping his arm firmly around her waist, as if trying to merge with her. Half-carrying Yvonne, he strode toward the bedroom. The bedroom curtains were drawn tight, letting in just a sliver of moonlight. Reid kicked open the door with a dull thud.\nHe carried Yvonne to the bed and gently laid her on the soft mattress. Her hair spread out like a ribbon of silk on the white sheets, making her look incredibly inviting.\nReid hovered over her, his breath hot and heavy, as if he was about to devour her whole.\nHis fingers traced along her collarbone, trembling slightly—part reverence, part possession. The desire in his eyes was so deep it could drown a person, yet he still clung to the last thread of self-control.\n“Can I?” he asked, his voice low and hoarse.\n“Do it,” she whispered, eyes shut, breath uneven. “Just don’t make me regret it.”\nThat was all it took—his restraint snapped.\nHis lips and tongue descended on her neck, her collarbone, her chest, feverish and wild, like a beast finally unchained. He kissed her with reckless hunger, claiming every inch of her burning skin. His body pressed tightly against hers, hard and hot, his need barely contained even through the layers of fabric.\nShe tilted her head back, gasping softly, her whole body shivering under his mouth.\nThen he tore her clothes from her body with near-brutal urgency, stripping her bare beneath the moonlight and the fire in his eyes. Her skin trembled with need, and he looked down at her like she was everything he’d ever wanted.\nWith a guttural groan, Reid yanked off the last of his clothes. He positioned himself between her thighs, grinding against her slick warmth, the head of his cock dragging over her most sensitive spot—hot, thick, and pulsing with restraint on the edge.\n“Let me in,” he rasped, voice nearly broken. “I can’t wait anymore.”\nShe lifted her leg, wrapped it around his waist, and pulled him toward her.\nIn the next breath, he thrust into her—hard, deep, claiming.\nShe arched violently beneath him, her cry caught between pain and overwhelming pleasure. That fullness, that pressure, that long-awaited invasion made her moan aloud, helpless.\nReid moved like a man possessed—his rhythm relentless, heavy, every thrust sending a jolt straight through her spine. Yet even in his frenzy, he kissed her—on the mouth, her neck, her breast—as if he couldn’t bear a single inch of her to go untouched.\nSweat rolled down his back, dripping onto her heaving chest, mixing with her heat, their bodies slick and scorching.\nShe clung to him, her nails clawing into the muscles of his back, her moans growing louder with each thrust. He was driving her mad—pushing her, pounding her, unraveling her completely.\n“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted you,” he growled into her ear. “Since the first damn day I saw you, I’ve wanted to pin you down and make you beg me not to stop.”\nShe cried out—not from pain, but from sheer, raw pleasure. The way he needed her... it undid her.\n“Harder,” she pleaded, her voice broken and hoarse.\nAnd he gave it to her—his pace brutal, desperate, like he was pouring years of jealousy, restraint, and hunger into her body.\nThe room was filled with the sound of panting breaths, flesh against flesh, the bed creaking under the force of their union. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and lust.\nShe lost herself in his arms, climaxing again and again, until she didn’t know where she ended and he began. There was only Reid. Only him. His body. His voice. His love.\nWhen he finally buried himself deep inside her and groaned out his release, they both collapsed, trembling and wrecked, into each other’s arms.\n“This changes everything,” he murmured.\nAnd in that moment, Yvonne knew he was right.\nThe room seemed to grow warmer, with a romantic vibe filling every corner. Moonlight peeked through the curtain gaps, highlighting their entwined figures in a charming and fascinating scene.\n\n---\nYvonne woke early with Reid's arm around her waist and his gentle breaths against her neck. The warmth stirred mixed emotions in her heart. He had finally settled down at dawn and was now sleeping deeply, a slight smile on his lips.\nReid was undeniably handsome, with features finely sculpted like a statue—deep eyes, a high nose, and slightly pursed lips that exuded an irresistible charm. The Simmons family was one of the top-tier families in Avaloria. Approaching thirty, Reid had never been involved in any scandals.\nBefore Yvonne met him, people around Steven had mentioned that Reid might be gay. Last night, she had personally confirmed that Reid was not only straight but also very much the opposite.\nAs she thought about it, a slight blush appeared on her cheeks. She gently got up, moving carefully to avoid waking the man behind her.\nShe bent down to pick up the clothes scattered all over the floor, pausing when she saw the black stockings from last night. They were torn into pieces, reminding her of his wild actions.\nShe threw the stockings in the trash and quietly slipped out, carrying her clothes.\n\n---\nWhen Yvonne got home, Steven hadn't returned yet. After she took a shower, Iona, who had just woken up, was sitting in the living room drinking water. As soon as she saw Yvonne, she said, \"What time is it? Why haven't you made breakfast yet?\"\nWithout a word, Yvonne went into the kitchen to make cereal, but only enough for herself.\nWhen she came out with the cereal, Iona asked, \"Where's Steven? Still in bed?\"\n\"He left last night,\" Yvonne said simply.\nIona paused, clicked her tongue, and looked Yvonne up and down with disdain. \"Can't even handle your own man. Worthless.\"\nIona looked at the cereal in her hand and snorted, \"No wonder he doesn't want to eat this plain stuff. I'm not eating it either; it doesn't look appetizing at all.\"\nWith that, she got up and called a friend she hadn't known for long. \"Let's gather for a game night. I won 3 thousand yesterday. Let's keep it going today. Nobody's allowed to ditch.\"\nYvonne sat at the dining table, lowered her head, and took a spoonful of cereal. The taste was mild, not very filling.\nBut when one was at their weakest and hungriest, a big meal would be too much, while a simple bowl of cereal could nourish the body.\nShe was eating while scrolling through her phone. She saw that a post about Sharon's alleged prostitution had climbed to the top of Sharon's school's online page early in the morning. The post had pictures and seemed convincing, thrusting Sharon into the spotlight.\nSharon argued that the man was her boyfriend and wanted Steven to step in and solve it. But Yvonne knew Steven was busy making the company go public, and with the post gaining traction, there was no way he'd expose himself.\nSharon couldn't explain herself and had to silently bear the blame. With everyone gossiping, she went through a round of online shaming, no matter what the real story was.\nJust then, a message alert sounded from Yvonne's phone. [Ms. Stark, does the plan continue?]\nYvonne chuckled softly and replied, [Yeah.]\nAfter seeing the \"read\" notification, she erased the message and thought to herself, 'Great. Everything is going according to plan.'\nIn the afternoon, Yvonne went back to her matrimonial home. As she opened the door, the faint smell of disinfectant filled the room. She wrinkled her nose slightly and then opened all the windows and doors.\nShe then returned to her bedroom, glanced at the calendar, and started sorting out her belongings.\nWhen Steven returned, he immediately noticed a cardboard box at her feet, and his heart skipped a beat. \"What's this? Planning to run away?\"\nYvonne looked up at the man who now seemed like a stranger, sneering inwardly, 'After a trip to the police station, he's now pretending to be all gentlemanly.'\n\"No, just sorting through some of my old stuff,\" she replied, her voice calm and indifferent.\nSteven's gaze fell on a photo album in her hands from when they were young, and he felt a little relieved.\nYvonne loved collecting photos, meaningful or not; she liked having them printed and put into albums. She once said that photos on the phone lacked the real-time feel and only physical albums held truly special memories.\nSteven's expression softened, his eyes becoming more gentle. \"I'm just back to change clothes. I've got an event tonight; wait for me to come back.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, her eyes showing no emotion, as though she hadn't heard a word he said.\nSteven took off his shirt, and Yvonne saw the various hickies on him and lowered her eyes.\nSteven seemed to realize something wasn't right, so he put his shirt back on and walked toward the bathroom. At the door, he suddenly stopped and turned around to say, \"Oh, I forgot. Reid's downstairs. Can you go entertain him?\"\nYvonne was startled, stopped for a moment, then closed the photo album and went downstairs.\nReid stood in the living room, sunlight outlining his tall, strong figure. He held a photo frame with a picture of Yvonne and Steven. Yvonne watched him from the bottom step.\nReid heard a sound, placed the frame face down on the table, and looked up. His eyes were a bit narrow, now filled with a deep, mysterious light, like a sky full of stars.\nHis gaze seemed to see through everything, landing right on Yvonne and making her heart skip a beat. \"What do you want to drink?\" Yvonne asked.\n\"Something sour,\" Reid said with a teasing tone.\nYvonne paused, shot him a look, then opened the fridge, took out a bottle of lemonade, and handed it to him.\nReid was momentarily stunned, squinted his eyes a bit, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. As he reached out to get the drink, he suddenly pulled her arm, drawing her into his arms, and they both fell back onto the sofa.\n\"Are you crazy? Let me go,\" Yvonne whispered sharply.\nReid held her close, leaned in, and whispered slowly in her ear, \"Yvonne, you really think you can just leave after sharing a bed, huh? Planning to act like nothing happened?\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nThere are limited chapters to put here, click “learn more” to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)\n0:00 / 0:16",

Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\n\n##2.Chapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n\n---\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\n\n##3.Chapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n\n---\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\n\n##4.Chapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n\n##5.Chapter 5 Reid's Downstairs\nBefore Yvonne could finish speaking, a fierce gleam flashed in Reid's eyes. Like a wild animal finally breaking free from its cage, he couldn't hold back any longer. He lowered his head, his face set with a reckless determination, and kissed Yvonne hard.\nThe sudden kiss left Yvonne's mind completely blank. Her first instinct was to pull away, but Reid's grip was like a vise, holding her tightly and leaving her unable to move.\nHis kiss was passionate and forceful, carrying an intensity that was impossible to resist. He parted her lips, exploring her mouth with a burning hunger.\nYvonne could feel his eagerness and longing—an emotion that had been bottled up for far too long. Gradually, her body went limp in his arms, and a strange, thrilling sensation spread through her.\nIt was a new kind of desire, one that made her heart race and her mind spin. Without realizing it, she began to kiss him back.\nReid shivered, wrapping his arm firmly around her waist, as if trying to merge with her. Half-carrying Yvonne, he strode toward the bedroom. The bedroom curtains were drawn tight, letting in just a sliver of moonlight. Reid kicked open the door with a dull thud.\nHe carried Yvonne to the bed and gently laid her on the soft mattress. Her hair spread out like a ribbon of silk on the white sheets, making her look incredibly inviting.\nReid hovered over her, his breath hot and heavy, as if he was about to devour her whole.\nHis fingers traced along her collarbone, trembling slightly—part reverence, part possession. The desire in his eyes was so deep it could drown a person, yet he still clung to the last thread of self-control.\n“Can I?” he asked, his voice low and hoarse.\n“Do it,” she whispered, eyes shut, breath uneven. “Just don’t make me regret it.”\nThat was all it took—his restraint snapped.\nHis lips and tongue descended on her neck, her collarbone, her chest, feverish and wild, like a beast finally unchained. He kissed her with reckless hunger, claiming every inch of her burning skin. His body pressed tightly against hers, hard and hot, his need barely contained even through the layers of fabric.\nShe tilted her head back, gasping softly, her whole body shivering under his mouth.\nThen he tore her clothes from her body with near-brutal urgency, stripping her bare beneath the moonlight and the fire in his eyes. Her skin trembled with need, and he looked down at her like she was everything he’d ever wanted.\nWith a guttural groan, Reid yanked off the last of his clothes. He positioned himself between her thighs, grinding against her slick warmth, the head of his cock dragging over her most sensitive spot—hot, thick, and pulsing with restraint on the edge.\n“Let me in,” he rasped, voice nearly broken. “I can’t wait anymore.”\nShe lifted her leg, wrapped it around his waist, and pulled him toward her.\nIn the next breath, he thrust into her—hard, deep, claiming.\nShe arched violently beneath him, her cry caught between pain and overwhelming pleasure. That fullness, that pressure, that long-awaited invasion made her moan aloud, helpless.\nReid moved like a man possessed—his rhythm relentless, heavy, every thrust sending a jolt straight through her spine. Yet even in his frenzy, he kissed her—on the mouth, her neck, her breast—as if he couldn’t bear a single inch of her to go untouched.\nSweat rolled down his back, dripping onto her heaving chest, mixing with her heat, their bodies slick and scorching.\nShe clung to him, her nails clawing into the muscles of his back, her moans growing louder with each thrust. He was driving her mad—pushing her, pounding her, unraveling her completely.\n“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted you,” he growled into her ear. “Since the first damn day I saw you, I’ve wanted to pin you down and make you beg me not to stop.”\nShe cried out—not from pain, but from sheer, raw pleasure. The way he needed her... it undid her.\n“Harder,” she pleaded, her voice broken and hoarse.\nAnd he gave it to her—his pace brutal, desperate, like he was pouring years of jealousy, restraint, and hunger into her body.\nThe room was filled with the sound of panting breaths, flesh against flesh, the bed creaking under the force of their union. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and lust.\nShe lost herself in his arms, climaxing again and again, until she didn’t know where she ended and he began. There was only Reid. Only him. His body. His voice. His love.\nWhen he finally buried himself deep inside her and groaned out his release, they both collapsed, trembling and wrecked, into each other’s arms.\n“This changes everything,” he murmured.\nAnd in that moment, Yvonne knew he was right.\nThe room seemed to grow warmer, with a romantic vibe filling every corner. Moonlight peeked through the curtain gaps, highlighting their entwined figures in a charming and fascinating scene.\n\n---\nYvonne woke early with Reid's arm around her waist and his gentle breaths against her neck. The warmth stirred mixed emotions in her heart. He had finally settled down at dawn and was now sleeping deeply, a slight smile on his lips.\nReid was undeniably handsome, with features finely sculpted like a statue—deep eyes, a high nose, and slightly pursed lips that exuded an irresistible charm. The Simmons family was one of the top-tier families in Avaloria. Approaching thirty, Reid had never been involved in any scandals.\nBefore Yvonne met him, people around Steven had mentioned that Reid might be gay. Last night, she had personally confirmed that Reid was not only straight but also very much the opposite.\nAs she thought about it, a slight blush appeared on her cheeks. She gently got up, moving carefully to avoid waking the man behind her.\nShe bent down to pick up the clothes scattered all over the floor, pausing when she saw the black stockings from last night. They were torn into pieces, reminding her of his wild actions.\nShe threw the stockings in the trash and quietly slipped out, carrying her clothes.\n\n---\nWhen Yvonne got home, Steven hadn't returned yet. After she took a shower, Iona, who had just woken up, was sitting in the living room drinking water. As soon as she saw Yvonne, she said, \"What time is it? Why haven't you made breakfast yet?\"\nWithout a word, Yvonne went into the kitchen to make cereal, but only enough for herself.\nWhen she came out with the cereal, Iona asked, \"Where's Steven? Still in bed?\"\n\"He left last night,\" Yvonne said simply.\nIona paused, clicked her tongue, and looked Yvonne up and down with disdain. \"Can't even handle your own man. Worthless.\"\nIona looked at the cereal in her hand and snorted, \"No wonder he doesn't want to eat this plain stuff. I'm not eating it either; it doesn't look appetizing at all.\"\nWith that, she got up and called a friend she hadn't known for long. \"Let's gather for a game night. I won 3 thousand yesterday. Let's keep it going today. Nobody's allowed to ditch.\"\nYvonne sat at the dining table, lowered her head, and took a spoonful of cereal. The taste was mild, not very filling.\nBut when one was at their weakest and hungriest, a big meal would be too much, while a simple bowl of cereal could nourish the body.\nShe was eating while scrolling through her phone. She saw that a post about Sharon's alleged prostitution had climbed to the top of Sharon's school's online page early in the morning. The post had pictures and seemed convincing, thrusting Sharon into the spotlight.\nSharon argued that the man was her boyfriend and wanted Steven to step in and solve it. But Yvonne knew Steven was busy making the company go public, and with the post gaining traction, there was no way he'd expose himself.\nSharon couldn't explain herself and had to silently bear the blame. With everyone gossiping, she went through a round of online shaming, no matter what the real story was.\nJust then, a message alert sounded from Yvonne's phone. [Ms. Stark, does the plan continue?]\nYvonne chuckled softly and replied, [Yeah.]\nAfter seeing the \"read\" notification, she erased the message and thought to herself, 'Great. Everything is going according to plan.'\nIn the afternoon, Yvonne went back to her matrimonial home. As she opened the door, the faint smell of disinfectant filled the room. She wrinkled her nose slightly and then opened all the windows and doors.\nShe then returned to her bedroom, glanced at the calendar, and started sorting out her belongings.\nWhen Steven returned, he immediately noticed a cardboard box at her feet, and his heart skipped a beat. \"What's this? Planning to run away?\"\nYvonne looked up at the man who now seemed like a stranger, sneering inwardly, 'After a trip to the police station, he's now pretending to be all gentlemanly.'\n\"No, just sorting through some of my old stuff,\" she replied, her voice calm and indifferent.\nSteven's gaze fell on a photo album in her hands from when they were young, and he felt a little relieved.\nYvonne loved collecting photos, meaningful or not; she liked having them printed and put into albums. She once said that photos on the phone lacked the real-time feel and only physical albums held truly special memories.\nSteven's expression softened, his eyes becoming more gentle. \"I'm just back to change clothes. I've got an event tonight; wait for me to come back.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, her eyes showing no emotion, as though she hadn't heard a word he said.\nSteven took off his shirt, and Yvonne saw the various hickies on him and lowered her eyes.\nSteven seemed to realize something wasn't right, so he put his shirt back on and walked toward the bathroom. At the door, he suddenly stopped and turned around to say, \"Oh, I forgot. Reid's downstairs. Can you go entertain him?\"\nYvonne was startled, stopped for a moment, then closed the photo album and went downstairs.\nReid stood in the living room, sunlight outlining his tall, strong figure. He held a photo frame with a picture of Yvonne and Steven. Yvonne watched him from the bottom step.\nReid heard a sound, placed the frame face down on the table, and looked up. His eyes were a bit narrow, now filled with a deep, mysterious light, like a sky full of stars.\nHis gaze seemed to see through everything, landing right on Yvonne and making her heart skip a beat. \"What do you want to drink?\" Yvonne asked.\n\"Something sour,\" Reid said with a teasing tone.\nYvonne paused, shot him a look, then opened the fridge, took out a bottle of lemonade, and handed it to him.\nReid was momentarily stunned, squinted his eyes a bit, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. As he reached out to get the drink, he suddenly pulled her arm, drawing her into his arms, and they both fell back onto the sofa.\n\"Are you crazy? Let me go,\" Yvonne whispered sharply.\nReid held her close, leaned in, and whispered slowly in her ear, \"Yvonne, you really think you can just leave after sharing a bed, huh? Planning to act like nothing happened?\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------- \nThere are limited chapters to put here, click “learn more” to open App to continue reading (It will automatically jump to the book)\n0:00 / 0:16\nWEBSITE.LITERIESS.COM\n🔞Click to Read the Full Story👉\nLearn more"

        "primary_text": "I sat silently in the car while my husband made a call to his mistress.\n“Baby, if the money’s not enough, I’ll transfer another 300K,” he said gently, like I wasn’t sitting right beside him.\nHe said he was here to pick me up—but clearly, it wasn’t for me.\nThrough the window, I watched the rain pour in sheets, drowning any tears I might have shed.\nHe forgot how I used to fear thunderstorms, how I’d shiver until he wrapped me in his arms.\nNow he said, “She’s young. She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:19",

        "raw_text": "Active\nLibrary ID: 1243173060834661\nStarted running on 19 Jun 2025 · Total active time 9 hrs\nPlatforms\nThis ad is no longer active because it did not meet certain requirements.\nOpen Drop-down\nSee ad details\nA heart-warming love story\nSponsored\nI sat silently in the car while my husband made a call to his mistress.\n“Baby, if the money’s not enough, I’ll transfer another 300K,” he said gently, like I wasn’t sitting right beside him.\nHe said he was here to pick me up—but clearly, it wasn’t for me.\nThrough the window, I watched the rain pour in sheets, drowning any tears I might have shed.\nHe forgot how I used to fear thunderstorms, how I’d shiver until he wrapped me in his arms.\nNow he said, “She’s young. She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:19\nWEBSITE.METRONOVEL.COM\n🔞🔞Click to read the full novel👉👉\nLearn more"

        "primary_text": "I sat silently in the car while my husband made a call to his mistress.\n“Baby, if the money’s not enough, I’ll transfer another 300K,” he said gently, like I wasn’t sitting right beside him.\nHe said he was here to pick me up—but clearly, it wasn’t for me.\nThrough the window, I watched the rain pour in sheets, drowning any tears I might have shed.\nHe forgot how I used to fear thunderstorms, how I’d shiver until he wrapped me in his arms.\nNow he said, “She’s young. She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:12",

She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:12\nWEBSITE.METRONOVEL.COM\n🔞🔞Click to read the full novel👉👉\nLearn more"

She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:18",

She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:18\nWEBSITE.METRONOVEL.COM\n🔞🔞Click to read the full novel👉👉\nLearn more"

        "primary_text": "I sat silently in the car while my husband made a call to his mistress.\n“Baby, if the money’s not enough, I’ll transfer another 300K,” he said gently, like I wasn’t sitting right beside him.\nHe said he was here to pick me up—but clearly, it wasn’t for me.\nThrough the window, I watched the rain pour in sheets, drowning any tears I might have shed.\nHe forgot how I used to fear thunderstorms, how I’d shiver until he wrapped me in his arms.\nNow he said, “She’s young. She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:18",

        "raw_text": "Active\nLibrary ID: 709242628472224\nStarted running on 19 Jun 2025 · Total active time 7 hrs\nPlatforms\nThis ad is no longer active because it did not meet certain requirements.\nEU transparency\nOpen Drop-down\nSee ad details\nA heart-warming love story\nSponsored\nI sat silently in the car while my husband made a call to his mistress.\n“Baby, if the money’s not enough, I’ll transfer another 300K,” he said gently, like I wasn’t sitting right beside him.\nHe said he was here to pick me up—but clearly, it wasn’t for me.\nThrough the window, I watched the rain pour in sheets, drowning any tears I might have shed.\nHe forgot how I used to fear thunderstorms, how I’d shiver until he wrapped me in his arms.\nNow he said, “She’s young. She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:18\nWEBSITE.METRONOVEL.COM\n🔞🔞Click to read the full novel👉👉\nLearn more"

        "primary_text": "I sat silently in the car while my husband made a call to his mistress.\n“Baby, if the money’s not enough, I’ll transfer another 300K,” he said gently, like I wasn’t sitting right beside him.\nHe said he was here to pick me up—but clearly, it wasn’t for me.\nThrough the window, I watched the rain pour in sheets, drowning any tears I might have shed.\nHe forgot how I used to fear thunderstorms, how I’d shiver until he wrapped me in his arms.\nNow he said, “She’s young. She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:18",

She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:18\nWEBSITE.METRONOVEL.COM\n🔞🔞Click to read the full novel👉👉\nLearn more"

She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:18",

She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:18\nWEBSITE.METRONOVEL.COM\n🔞🔞Click to read the full novel👉👉\nLearn more"

        "primary_text": "I sat silently in the car while my husband made a call to his mistress.\n“Baby, if the money’s not enough, I’ll transfer another 300K,” he said gently, like I wasn’t sitting right beside him.\nHe said he was here to pick me up—but clearly, it wasn’t for me.\nThrough the window, I watched the rain pour in sheets, drowning any tears I might have shed.\nHe forgot how I used to fear thunderstorms, how I’d shiver until he wrapped me in his arms.\nNow he said, “She’s young. She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:18",

She’s afraid of thunder. I have to stay with her.”\nThen he left me—just like that.\n\nI stood in the storm, soaked to the bone, when a black car pulled up beside me.\nThe window rolled down—it was Reid.\nHis voice was calm and cold. “Get in.”\n\nI hesitated, then opened the door.\n\nThe car was warm and quiet. He offered me a blanket. He didn’t ask questions.\nBut as I reached my house and tried to get out, he stopped me.\nHis arm slipped around my waist, holding me firmly.\nHe leaned in close, his breath brushing my ear. “Yvonne, how long will you keep pretending for a man who cheats on you?”\n\nI smirked. “You’re no saint either.”\nHe stepped closer, heat radiating off his skin. “Maybe. But I never let anyone else touch what’s mine.”\n\nHis kiss was hard—punishing, claiming.\nI tried to resist, but he pinned me against the door, our mouths crashing together.\nMy breath caught, my fingers clung to his shirt, and my pulse pounded like thunder inside me.\n\nThat night, I realized something crystal clear:\nI’d rather be the sinner in Reid’s arms… than the forgotten wife in Steven’s bed.\n*****\nChapter 1 He Has A Lover\nThe rain fell in sheets, drumming against the windows of a black car as it crawled along the road. Inside, Yvonne Stark's calm face was visible through the window. Next to her, Steven Chapin, her husband, was on the phone with his lover.\n\"I didn't mean to miss picking you up from school today, baby. Something came up,\" he said, his tone dripping with apology.\n\"No. Who told you that? I didn't pick her up,\" Steven added, glancing at Yvonne. In the dim light, he could only see the outline of her profile.\nHe quickly looked away and focused again on the phone. \"Okay, get whatever you want. Do you have enough money? If not, I'll have my assistant transfer another 300 thousand to your account.\"\n\"What? You want to buy a house? Sure, we can check it out another day,\" he continued, trying to sound caring.\nAfter a few more minutes of sweet-talking, he reluctantly hung up. Yvonne kept staring out the window, her heart as still as a calm pond. The heated arguments of the past felt like distant memories now.\nShe and Steven had known each other for fifteen years, going through the hardest times together. They had lived in run-down apartments and eaten cold noodles, dreaming of growing old together. But now, it felt like they'd lost almost all affection for each other.\nYvonne's lips curled into a self-mocking smile as she thought to herself, 'What was once beautiful is now just a thing of the past.'\n\"Honey, are you upset? Those other women don't mean anything. It's just a game. Don't take it seriously,\" Steven said.\nYvonne glanced back at him, a faint trace of sarcasm on her face. \"Just a game?\"\nSteven chuckled and reached out to hug her. \"Of course. Don't worry. They can never be a threat to your position.\"\nYvonne avoided his hand, her eyes full of disgust. \"You've been keeping that mistress at Riverside Estates for over a year. Your little 'game' has gone on long enough.\"\nSteven smiled, with an unexpected touch of warmth in his eyes. \"She's not like the others. She sort of reminds me of how you used to be.\"\nYvonne didn't say anything else. She turned her head, leaned back against the seat, and closed her eyes.\nThey'd been living apart for over a year. This time, she'd been on a business trip for more than two weeks, working late into the night for days. She didn't remember having a husband until he suddenly arrived at the airport to pick her up.\n\"Honey, did you miss me?\" Steven leaned closer, his voice soft and coaxing. His breath brushed Yvonne's ear, but it only made her feel a wave of disgust.\nYvonne turned her head, too weary to talk. Steven was taken aback for a moment.\nOutside the car, the rain was getting heavier, forming a continuous sheet, while thunder roared as if it wanted to swallow the whole world.\nSteven's phone rang again and he picked it up with a sigh. \"What's wrong this time?\"\n\"Scared?\" he asked, his tone changing.\nYvonne could faintly hear someone sobbing on the other end. She twisted her lips into a mocking smile.\n\"Alright, alright, I'll come and stay with you. I'll be there soon. Wait for me,\" Steven said, hanging up.\nHe turned to Yvonne and said with a troubled look on his face, \"I really need to go. She's still young and gets scared easily.\"\nYvonne slowly opened her eyes which were filled with tiredness and indifference. \"Okay. Stop the car ahead. I'll go back on my own.\"\nSteven hesitated, looking at the heavy rain. \"It's pouring outside. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\nYvonne responded with a sneer. Deep down, she muttered, 'My husband is about to leave me halfway to see his mistress, yet he acts like he cares about my safety.'\nShe said, \"Steven, isn't it boring? She's the 'young girl,' and I'm the 'older woman.' I'm too old to be scared of thunderstorms anymore.\"\nShe added in her mind, 'He probably doesn't even remember it. After that rainy night back then, I'd been so scared of thunder for a long time that I needed him by my side to sleep every night.\n'He forgot about my fear and his old promises. He's been my savior, and now he is going to save another girl. How ironic.'\nSteven replied, \"Honey, don't make a fuss, okay? I'll try to find some time in the next couple of days—\"\n\"Stop,\" Yvonne cut him off while raising her hand, her voice getting louder. \"Stop pretending. I'm tired and want to rest.\"\nSteven's face darkened. He felt Yvonne was becoming more and more unreasonable. \"Pull over,\" he shouted to the driver.\nThe car slowly stopped by the roadside. Yvonne grabbed her handbag and, without hesitation, opened the door and stepped into the cold, rainy night with her umbrella in hand. The rain quickly soaked her dress, but she didn't seem to notice.\nSteven watched her disappear into the darkness, feeling annoyed. 'Her temper is getting out of control; she needs a strong reminder,' he thought. Then he said, \"Drive.\"\nThe car sped away, splashing water behind it. Yvonne stood in the rain, looking back at the taillights fading into the darkness. She let out a cold laugh. 'Steven,' she muttered inwardly, 'I hope you'll still have this confidence when you have nothing left.'\nJust then, the sound of a car horn cut through the air. A Rolls-Royce Cullinan slowly approached Yvonne from the end of the road and pulled over.\nThe window rolled down to reveal Reid Simmons's handsome face. He looked at Yvonne and said in a flat tone, \"Get in. I'll give you a ride.\"\nWith that, he closed the window. The car stayed quietly by the roadside as if he was certain Yvonne would get in.\nYvonne hesitated for a moment. She looked down the road, considered whether she could get another ride, and finally opened the back door, and got into the car.\n\"Serenity Villas,\" Reid said in a calm voice.\n\"Yes, Mr. Simmons,\" replied the driver.\nYvonne's dress was damp and stuck to her legs from the rain earlier. Reid glanced sideways at her and handed her a new blanket from the car without saying anything.\nYvonne took it and draped it over her legs, feeling the warmth spread slowly. Neither of them spoke, and the car was quiet.\nReid looked down at the file in his hands, occasionally flipping through the pages. The small space was filled only with the soft sound of turning pages.\nA while later, the driver said, \"Mr. Simmons, we've arrived.\"\n\"Okay,\" Reid replied, turning to look at the rain outside, which didn't seem to be letting up.\nYvonne folded the blanket and set it aside. After thinking for a moment, she turned back and said, \"Thanks.\"\nReid didn't respond. He just put away the file he was holding, his eyes closely following her as she got out of the car with an umbrella.\nHer umbrella was a bit too small for the heavy rain. After she took only a few steps, her shoulders and back were soaked. Her black dress clung to her, highlighting her graceful figure.\nReid tugged at his tie in frustration, his eyes deep. Suddenly, he opened the car door and quickly strode after her.\nAs Yvonne opened her front door, she heard hurried footsteps coming up fast from behind. Surprised, she quickly pushed the door open and slipped inside. Just as she was about to close it, Reid's large hand stopped the door. He pushed his way in firmly.\nThe door slammed shut behind him and meanwhile, he pulled Yvonne with his arm around her waist.\nYvonne bumped into his chest, the chill on her disappearing with his warmth. \"Let go,\" she said coldly.\nReid chuckled softly and replied, \"Yvonne, are you planning to keep him on a leash? He's like this, and you still won't divorce him?\"\n\"It's none of your business,\" she replied.\n\"Divorce him,\" Reid said. \"Be with me.\"\nYvonne scoffed, pulling him a bit closer by his tie. \"Reid, Steven's a jerk, and what makes you think you're any better? He's your best friend, yet you're after his wife.\"\nReid lowered his head, his deep eyes gleaming with a strange light. He leaned closer to Yvonne's ear and muttered, his voice low and captivating, \"Best friend? Yvonne, the only difference is that I never mess around.\"\n\"You two are alike,\" Yvonne snorted.\nReid raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Yvonne's phone suddenly rang. She took out her phone and saw it was Steven calling. Irritated, she didn't want to answer.\nReid glanced sideways at her and suddenly grabbed her phone. \"How about I answer it for you?\" he said with a sly grin, and there was a provocative look in his eyes.\nChapter 2 I'll Do It For You\nYvonne's eyes widened in shock, and she quickly stretched up on her tiptoes, trying to grab the phone from Reid's hand.\nBut Reid was tall, and with just a slight lift of his arm, she couldn't reach it no matter how many times she tried. Unknowingly, she leaned forward, almost clinging to him.\nReid looked down at Yvonne, a smile tugged at the corners of his lips and his gaze gentle and warm.\nHis eyes sparkled with mischief, but beneath that, a hint of something deeper flickered—a tender and subtle affection. He just stood there, watching her flail around like a kid trying to reach a cookie jar.\n\"Reid!\" Yvonne's eyes widened even more when she saw him tap and slide the green button on the phone.\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember the Yara Jewelry set in your closet? She liked it, so I gave it to her.\" Steven's voice came through.\nReid put the phone on speaker and held it up in front of her. Yvonne looked at him, her expression serious.\nReid smiled, wrapped his arm around her waist, and pulled her closer, bringing the phone to her ear. \"Did you hear that?\" Steven asked on the other end.\nYvonne chuckled, thinking about how she'd been trying to figure out how to \"get rid of\" that jewelry. It turned out Steven had just solved her problem for her.\nSteven was silent for a moment. Then a clear voice rang out from the other end. \"Darling, who are you calling?\"\nSteven replied, \"Well, I'm just calling my assistant to bring over some clothes tomorrow—\"\nBefore Steven could finish, Reid abruptly hung up. He looked down at Yvonne, feeling a bit sorry. \"Yvonne, are you so tolerant?\" he sneered. \"You're his legal wife, but it looks like you're the one having an affair. How much do you really love him?\"\nYvonne didn't say anything. She stepped out of his embrace and walked into the room, phone in hand.\nReid spoke slowly from behind her, \"Yvonne, for that little favor, how many more years are you going to stick with this? I'll give you two weeks. If you don't divorce him by then, I'll do it for you.\"\nWith that, he kicked the nearby cabinet in frustration, stormed out the door, and disappeared into the rainy mist.\nYvonne stayed calm, filled the bathtub with water, and submerged herself until she couldn't hold her breath any longer and had to come up for air.\nWater droplets rolled down her hair and cheeks. She was slightly out of breath, and the bathroom was filled with steamy mist that blurred her vision.\nShe quietly leaned against the edge of the tub, took out her phone, and checked the calendar. It was July 18th.\n'It's almost time. Hang in there, Yvonne,' she told herself in her mind. 'Just a little longer, and you'll have repaid the Chapin family's kindness. You're almost free. Then, it'll be time to settle things.'\n*****\nThat night, Yvonne had a deep sleep, and when she groggily woke up, she heard some noise coming from downstairs.\nShe got up, walked out, and stood in the hallway, looking down. She saw Steven in the kitchen, making fried eggs. The kitchen lights were warm and soft, casting a glow on him, but Yvonne felt incredibly distant from him.\nA girl in a white dress hugged him from behind, saying playfully, \"Darling, just over-medium, please.\" Her voice was sweet and full of happiness.\nSteven smiled indulgently and replied, \"Okay, whatever you say.\"\nYvonne paused for a moment. Back then, she and Steven had lived in a tiny rental place, where life was tough but cozy.\nSteven would get all sweaty just making her a simple meal, and he'd be really happy about getting an egg fried just right. They'd plan their future together in that tiny apartment.\nBut now, their houses had gotten bigger, and he'd become so busy that he didn't have time to cook for her or even come home.\nLater, Yvonne saw him do a lot of romantic things together with Sharon Evans, his lover, finally realizing that \"being busy\" was just an excuse once someone's feelings changed.\nYvonne turned around, went into her bedroom to change her clothes, and came out carrying a bowl of water.\nBy then, Steven and Sharon were seated at the dining table, already eating. Yvonne stood upstairs, looking down at them, and poured the bowl of water over them.\nWater splashed onto the fancy plates, ruining the food instantly. Sharon screamed, and Steven stood up abruptly. They both looked up to see Yvonne staring at them coldly, her eyes devoid of emotion.\nSteven angrily shouted, \"Are you crazy?\" Then he grabbed a napkin to quickly wipe Sharon's face.\nYvonne slowly walked down the stairs, glanced at the woman in Steven's arms a few times, and suddenly said, \"Let her stand up so I can get a good look.\" She remembered Steven mentioning the night before that Sharon looked a bit like her.\nSharon looked up, startled, and quickly hid in Steven's arms again. Steven patted her head and turned to Yvonne, his voice serious. \"There's no need for that. You're scaring her.\"\nYvonne stood there quietly for a moment, watching Steven and the protective look on his face.\nThe boy she remembered, who once held half a stale pie and promised her a good life, had long disappeared. Now, he was polished by money, stuck in a mess, dirty inside and out.\n\"Steven, I remember you promised not to bring other women here,\" Yvonne said.\nThe house was their marriage home, and she did the interior design personally. To save money back then, she had visited the market many times to ensure every detail was perfect. She had overseen every tiny thing herself.\nSteven paused for a moment, then got up and said, \"Oh, I just came back to get a document.\" He added in his mind, 'Sharon is clingy and insisted on following me in. Then she said she was hungry, so...'\n\"I thought you had gone to work,\" he continued.\nYvonne glanced at Sharon. Sharon was very young, her face full of youth, and her eyes showed innocence and fearlessness—a purity untouched by life.\nSharon seemed to feel Yvonne's gaze and slightly lifted her chin, a bit of challenge in her eyes.\nYvonne gave a soft laugh and slowly moved toward them, each step seeming decisive as if she was walking on Steven's nerves.\nInstinctively, Steven shielded Sharon, stepping back a few steps. \"Yvonne, don't make a scene—\"\n\"I'm not causing a scene. Bringing her back here is quite a blow to my face. It's not very appropriate, is it?\" Yvonne said.\nTheir clothes were mostly soaked through, with water still dripping from the edges, making them look very messy. Sharon was shivering with cold in Steven's arms.\nSteven asked, \"What do you want?\"\nYvonne extended a finger, gently curled it, and declared, her tone firm, \"Either of you, come here and get a slap from me, and we'll be even.\"\nSteven's face darkened as he held Sharon more protectively. \"Yvonne, don't push it.\"\nYvonne said coldly, \"Okay. I have several properties under my name. I'll put them up for sale today.\n\"Steven, the company is about to go public. You wouldn't want people to say your wife is in a hurry to sell off assets and suspect you're having financial trouble, right?\"\nSteven went silent after hearing that. Yvonne looked at him coldly.\nAfter a while, Steven slowly lowered his head, looking at Sharon with a bit of hesitation and struggle in his eyes. He then whispered softly, \"Sweetheart, just bear it for my sake. I have a meeting later.\"\nSharon looked at him in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief. \"Wh-what did you say?\"\nSteven gently let go of Sharon, placed his hands on her shoulders, and gave her a slight push forward, making his intention clear.\nTears quickly filled Sharon's eyes. She choked on her words, saying, \"Steven, you—\" She was unable to finish her sentence. Yvonne showed no mercy and gave her a hard slap.\nA clear red mark appeared on Sharon's cheek. She opened her eyes wide, tears welling up as if she couldn't believe it really was happening.\nSteven was shocked too, not expecting Yvonne to actually strike.\nYvonne looked at Sharon with cold eyes. 'Too bad. She's so young yet she won't live a happy life in the future.'\nYvonne turned and called a cleaning service. \"Yes, clean the whole house, inside and out. After all, some dirt got in.\"\n\"Yvonne, is this really necessary?\" Steven shouted angrily.\nYvonne put her phone away and looked at the two. \"Could you please leave now? The cleaning service will be here soon. But if you stay, maybe they can clean you up too.\n\"I just wonder how many bottles of sanitizer it would take to clean you up.\"\n\"Ms. Stark, you—\"\n\"Steven, keep your dog on a leash. If you can't afford one... maybe you should just find a leash somewhere,\" Yvonne said coldly.\n\"Darling!\" Sharon held her swollen cheek, tears running down her face.\nSteven got up with a stern look, holding Sharon's hand as they walked out. At the door, he turned back and said, \"Mom wants us to come over for dinner this afternoon. Wait for me at the office; I'll pick you up.\"\nYvonne let out a mocking laugh.\nNot long after those two left, the cleaning crew arrived. Yvonne gave them a few instructions and then headed out.\nShe didn't go to the office. She had spent more than a week working tirelessly out of town, and the project was finally approved, so the company rewarded her with a three-day break.\nShe found a movie theater and bought tickets from morning till afternoon, not caring what movies were playing. Sitting by herself in a corner, she watched people on the screen go through the ups and downs of life.\nAfter watching a few movies, she started to feel it was all rather pointless. Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: [15.]\nEven without saving the number, Yvonne knew it was Reid. She had blocked countless numbers from him, yet he always found a new way to message her.\nShe deleted the message and blocked the number, leaving the movie theater to stroll aimlessly down the street.\nThe phone rang, and Yvonne picked it up, only to hear Steven's mom, Iona, angrily scolding her, \"Yvonne, didn't you agree to come back for dinner today? It's so late now. Why aren't you home cooking yet?\"\n\"Oh, coming,\" Yvonne replied.\n\"Hurry up, and I want that crispy chicken from the south side and those pickled radishes from the north side. Remember to bring them back,\" Iona demanded.\n\"Okay,\" Yvonne said, hanging up the phone. She saw a coffee shop across the street, went in, ordered a coffee, and sat quietly for a while.\nWhen Yvonne got back to the Chapin residence, it was almost six. Iona was playing cards with a few others. The room was filled with smoke and the noise of their chatting.\nAs soon as Iona saw Yvonne come in, she immediately snapped, \"Oh, you think you're still the rich girl from before, taking forever to make a meal? If you don't want to cook, just say so, instead of leaving me waiting all afternoon.\"\nIona's face was full of displeasure and disdain as she glanced at Yvonne from the corner of her eye.\nYvonne said calmly, \"You're right. I don't feel like cooking. You do it.\"\nIona was caught off guard, not expecting Yvonne to be so blunt. Seeing Yvonne come back empty-handed, she shouted even louder, \"Yvonne, you're getting bold, huh? Didn't I tell you to buy—\"\n\"I didn't go,\" Yvonne said flatly.\n\"You—\" Iona started, but Yvonne ignored her and walked into a different room.\nShe lit a candle, pressed her hands together, and bowed deeply three times to the photo of Albert, Steven's deceased father.\nAs she was leaving, she heard Iona continuing to badmouth her while playing cards with her friends.\n\"Always with that sour face, like doom and gloom, so annoying,\" Iona complained.\n\"I heard Steven has a lover. Doesn't Yvonne make a fuss?\" one of Iona's friends asked.\nIona boasted, \"She used to make a scene, but what's the use? Steven's career is doing so well. He's about to take his company public. If she causes trouble and Steven leaves her, what will she do then?\"\n\"Yvonne sure is lucky. She used to be a rich girl, and when her family lost everything, she was taken in by your family. She's never really had to suffer,\" another woman said.\n\"That's right. Without Steven, she would've been out on the streets. Now, she just won't leave. She's basically stuck serving my family for life. Oh, I just got another win,\" Iona gloated.\n\"Oh come on, how do you keep winning?\" one of the others grumbled.\n\"Pay up, now!\" Iona laughed.\nYvonne overheard their conversation, and a wave of deep sadness and resentment surged in her heart. They only saw Steven's success but overlooked the times she stood by him through hardships. Her past efforts seemed worthless to them.\nShe muttered inwardly, 'Albert, you wouldn't want to see her playing poker in front of you, would you? Don't worry. Soon she won't be playing at all... ever.'\nYvonne slowly stepped forward and, under the astonished eyes of everyone, she flipped the poker table with a violent motion. The cards scattered everywhere, the table hitting the floor with a thud.\n\"Yvonne! Have you lost your mind?\" Iona yelled.\nChapter 3 Come Pick Me Up\nWhen Steven came back later, he walked in to find a big mess. Iona was sitting on the floor, crying, and told him about what had happened as soon as she saw him.\nSteven looked upset after learning about everything and asked Yvonne, \"You've been causing a fuss since morning. What's going on? What do you want?\n\"Also, the company gave you a three-day leave. Why didn't you say anything? You didn't even answer the phone, making me wait downstairs for over two hours.\"\nYvonne glanced at him, her face calm, and said coolly, \"I waited for you so long before. I didn't lose my temper like you are now.\" Her voice was calm, and with no extra explanation, she turned to go upstairs.\nUpon hearing that, Iona mocked, \"With the lousy job you're doing, how much money can you really make in a year? Everything you eat, use, and wear—isn't it all provided by Steven? Honestly, I have no idea what your work is even for.\"\nYvonne smiled, thinking they both seemed to forget that in the year Steven's startup failed, it was her so-called \"lousy job\" that got them through.\nDuring those tough days, she lived frugally and worked hard just to keep their lives going. But now, they easily forgot all those sacrifices.\nYvonne and Steven stayed at the Chapin residence that night. Yvonne was reading in the room when Steven came in, glanced at her, tossed his phone and jacket aside, and went straight to the bathroom.\nSuddenly, his phone got a new message. She glanced at it out of habit. [Darling, you promised me you wouldn't touch her tonight. You better keep your word, or I won't talk to you anymore.]\nYvonne turned her gaze away. A short while later, Steven came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. She couldn't miss the deep hickey on his collarbone like it was shouting out to everyone.\nFollowing her gaze, Steven looked down and suddenly laughed, \"She was really upset today. It took me a long time to calm her. She knows I'm with you tonight and made quite a fuss.\"\nYvonne looked up at him and let out a mocking laugh. \"Steven, do you keep treating me like this because you think I won't leave?\"\nSteven paused a bit while drying his hair. A sudden tension gripped him as he saw Yvonne's indifferent look, sparking a bit of anger in him.\nHe said, \"Yvonne, after all these years of us being together, and with my family taking you in, you won't actually leave. This is how things are in this circle. Isn't it common for men with status to have a few women?\n\"You don't know how long I was the joke back then, and now they're all envious of me.\"\nYvonne knew what he meant. Naturally, they envied him for having a peaceful wife at home and an array of flings outside.\n\"Are you so sure?\" she said.\nSteven thought for a moment, tossed the towel aside, and smiled, \"Honey, I know I've gone a bit too far lately. Don't worry, I'll tone it down from now on and won't have her disturb you again.\n\"You'll always be my number one. How about I spend three days a week at home with you?\"\nHe spoke while walking over to the wardrobe, pulled out a black lace camisole dress, and placed it in Yvonne's hand.\nHe added, \"Babe, I've been after you for so many years. There's no way I don't want you. I just want to have some fun. No matter what, I'll always come home. If you wear this tonight, I—\"\nYvonne threw the dress on the ground and stood up, saying coldly, \"Don't treat me like those other women you see.\" With that, she headed into the bathroom.\nSteven paused for a moment, a sudden wave of panic washing over him. He felt as if Yvonne was about to vanish into thin air.\nBut then he thought about their past—those happy memories flashed in his mind. 'She owes my family a debt of gratitude, so how could she ever leave? I must be overthinking it,' he told himself in his mind.\nSteven waited in the room for a long time, but Yvonne still didn't come out. He was getting restless. Ever since he had an affair three years ago, Yvonne hadn't been with him; she thought he was disgusting.\nHe wondered, 'She's my wife, and it was just a physical affair, not an emotional one. Is that disgusting? I missed her, and tonight, no matter what, I have to—'\nJust then, his phone rang. He looked down, confused as to why Reid was calling him at this time.\n\"Reid?\"\n\"Did you sleep?\" asked Reid.\n\"Not yet. I'm at my mom's place.\"\nReid paused on the other end and then continued, \"Is your wife with you?\"\n\"Yeah. What's up?\"\nWith a \"click\" of the lighter, Reid lit a cigarette, took a drag, and said slowly, \"Well, isn't your company about to go public?\n\"I'm having dinner with some folks from the stock exchange tonight and thought of inviting you along, but it seems like you might be busy.\"\nSteven immediately replied, \"I'm free. Reid, send me the address and I'll head over right away.\"\nReid chuckled softly, \"Alright, hurry up then.\"\n\"Okay.\" Steven hung up the phone and quickly changed clothes. His eyes lit up instantly, and an excited look appeared on his face.\nEven though Reid was his friend, there was a world of difference in their power. The Simmons family was a top-tier wealthy clan, ranking among the top 100 globally. Many wanted to cozy up to them, yet Steven had managed to make friends with Reid.\nOver the years, Steven had relied on the scraps that had slipped through Reid's fingers to get to where he was today. Missing out on Reid's resources was not an option.\n\"Honey, I'm going out for a bit, and I won't be back tonight,\" Steven said, rushing out.\nYvonne was in the bathroom and naturally heard the phone call earlier. By the time she came out, Steven had already left. She sat at the dressing table drying her hair, casually took out her phone, and sent a message: [Plan canceled for tonight.]\n[Got it, Ms. Stark.] The reply came swiftly.\nYvonne deleted the messages and then saw a text from an unknown number: [I got him out of the way for you tonight. How are you going to thank me?]\nReid had texted her from a new number. Yvonne glanced at it but didn't reply.\nAfter a while, he texted again: [Forget it, it's not worth it. I'll just tell him to return.]\nYvonne hadn't planned to respond, but after a moment, something came to mind, and she replied: [What do you want?]\nReid: [I'm drunk. Come pick me up.]\nYvonne: [Okay, but there's a catch.]\nReid: [Alright, I'll go along with that.]\n*****\nReid had given the address of a club located in the busy part of the city, with luxurious decor and bright lights. When Yvonne arrived, Reid's bodyguard, Henry Carter, was already waiting downstairs.\n\"Ms. Stark, Mr. Simmons is waiting for you upstairs,\" Henry said. Yvonne followed him up.\nHenry guided her to a quiet room and opened the door. \"Please, Ms. Stark,\" he said. Yvonne walked in slowly, and Henry gently closed the door and stood outside.\nThe room was softly lit. Reid was sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. His eyes looked a bit sleepy and his cheeks were slightly red from drinking, making him appear even more attractive.\nHe glanced at Yvonne, gave a smile, and motioned with his hand. \"Come here.\"\nYvonne slowly walked over. Reid chuckled softly, then suddenly reached out and grabbed her slender wrist, pulling her into his arms. His move was so quick that Yvonne couldn't react in time.\n\"You—\" she started.\n\"Quiet.\" Reid gently put his finger on Yvonne's lips, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Yvonne was a bit surprised, her body stiff as she leaned against him, unsure how to react.\nReid lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, \"Listen.\"\nYvonne looked in the direction he indicated and realized that the room was divided by just a screen. A heavy curtain hung on this side. Even though she couldn't see the other side, she could clearly hear the sounds from there.\nAt that moment, the door closed next door, followed by a playful voice. \"Darling, why did you drink so much?\"\nThe voice was full of concern and a touch of playfulness, and Yvonne knew right away it was Sharon.\nSteven, his voice slurred with drunkenness, said, \"Uh, I'm just happy today.\" It was clear he had had quite a lot to drink.\nSteven met some of the top people from the stock exchange, and they were all positive about his company, even saying he was quite talented for someone so young. He felt a bit full of himself, and he ended up drinking more than usual.\n\"Darling, let's go home,\" Sharon said again.\n\"Home, yeah, I should go home now. My wife is waiting for me there.\"\nReid got closer to Yvonne and whispered, \"What do you think would happen if he knew that his wife was right next door figuring out how to deal with them?\"\nChapter 4 The Plot\nYvonne lowered her head, her face partly hidden in the shadows. It was hard for Reid to see her expression. He couldn't help but hold her closer. He felt bad for her but also wanted to push her not to waste more time on Steven.\n\"Darling! I knew it. She's the one you love the most,\" Sharon said, her voice dripping with jealousy.\nSteven sobered up a bit and said, \"It's you, babe. What are you doing here?\"\n\"Didn't you text me, telling me to pick you up?\" she replied.\nSteven glanced at his phone and saw there was indeed a message. Maybe he'd drunk too much and couldn't remember clearly.\nSeeing Sharon was upset, he smiled and pulled her onto his lap. Still a bit dizzy, he leaned back on the sofa with her in his arms. \"Babe, don't be mad. You're the one I love the most. How could she compare to you?\"\nReid leaned in, his breath tickling Yvonne's ear. \"Yvonne, he doesn't love you anymore.\"\nYvonne stayed silent, not saying a word.\nSharon's voice carried a hint of sobbing. \"But you just said you wanted to go home and be with her.\"\nSteven sighed, \"Why are you crying? It's been years since I was not with her. When have you ever woken up without me next to you?\"\nSharon was still a bit angry, so Steven clicked his tongue and said, \"Stop it, okay? I'll buy you the purse you wanted.\"\n\"Really?\" Sharon asked.\n\"Yeah, and that 'Emerald Heart' you wanted? I'll get it for you at the auction in a few days,\" Steven promised.\n\"You're the best,\" Sharon said, breaking into a smile as she stopped crying.\nSteven gently said, \"If I'm not good to you, then who else? Isn't all the money I earn for you to spend?\"\nWhen Yvonne heard that, her eyes flashed with deep sarcasm and hatred. The \"Emerald Heart\" had been her mother's jewelry. When Steven started his second business without much money, Yvonne sold it to help out.\nAfter Steven found out, he held her and promised he'd buy it back for her one day. But now, he planned to give it to another girl.\nReid said softly, \"Maybe I can bid on it and give it back to you?\"\n\"No need. Money should be spent wisely, and things should be used to their fullest,\" Yvonne replied, her voice firm.\nSeeing her determined expression, Reid didn't push it.\nGradually, suggestive sounds came from next door. The breathing of Steven and Sharon got quick and heavy. Sharon's voice was a bit flirty. \"Darling, not here...\"\nSteven's voice was laced with desire. \"Don't worry, no one will come.\"\nWith that, the soft sound of clothes being taken off could be heard. Yvonne closed her eyes, suddenly feeling sick.\n\"Do we leave now?\" Reid asked. Yvonne turned to look at him and nodded quietly.\nReid carried her in her arms and walked out quickly. \"Put me down,\" Yvonne said softly.\nReid stopped for a moment, looking down at her. Yvonne stayed calm, her beautiful eyes seeming to look at him but not really seeing him.\nHe put her down. The noise startled the two in the next room.\n\"Who's there?\" Steven asked in surprise.\nReid said, \"Steven, you sure know how to have a good time.\"\nHearing Reid's voice, Steven immediately let out a sigh of relief, his tone a mix of flattery and awkwardness. \"Reid? I thought you'd already left.\"\n\"Just about to. But didn't you say your wife was waiting for you at home? Why aren't you going back?\"\nSteven went silent. Sharon suddenly bit him, making him gasp in pain. \"I'm not going back,\" he finally said.\n\"Okay, have fun,\" Reid said as he opened the door. Yvonne walked out quietly with him. Henry followed them.\nWhen they reached the next room's door, they could still hear some suggestive sounds coming from inside. Reid stopped and said to Yvonne, \"The person is ready, just like you asked.\"\nYvonne nodded, walked out of the club, and looked up at the lights in the room above. Then she took out her phone and called the police. \"Hello, is that the police? I'd like to report some prostitution.\"\nYvonne and Reid stood in the corner, watching as the police led two people out. Reid looked at the commotion outside the club, feeling a sense of satisfaction.\n\"Everything's set up. The photos will be uploaded to her school's online forum tonight, and by tomorrow, there will be rumors about her involvement in prostitution,\" Reid said, his voice low.\nYvonne glanced over, didn't linger, and turned to leave. Reid followed behind her. \"Yvonne, do you really still care about him that much? You even want me to keep his news out.\"\nYvonne turned around and said, \"What else could I do? Starlight Tech Innovations is about to go public. How would it help me if he's in trouble now?\"\nReid nodded and didn't say anything else.\nThe three of them walked to the car, and Henry handed Yvonne the keys. Yvonne looked at him, puzzled.\nHenry said, \"Ms. Stark, I've taken the day off. I'm going to spend it with my girlfriend.\"\nReid flicked her forehead with a smile and said, \"You didn't think I was kidding, did you? I've had some drinks and can't drive, so I really needed you to pick me up.\"\nYvonne glanced at both of them as Henry pushed the keys into her hand.\nReid glanced up at the room upstairs, a smile showing on his lips. Then he opened the passenger door and got in.\nYvonne stood still and said, \"I'm not driving.\"\nReid suddenly seemed to remember something, quickly opened the car door, got out, and took the keys back from her. \"Fine, then we won't drive.\" He then took her hand and hailed a taxi.\nAfter they got into the taxi, Reid leaned back with his eyes closed, pinching the bridge of his nose as the alcohol started to kick in. Outside the window, the city lights flickered in the night.\nWhen they arrived, Yvonne woke him up. Reid opened his eyes, looked outside, then turned to Yvonne and asked, \"How did you know I live here?\"\nWhen he got in the car, he didn't say where he wanted to go, just willing to go wherever she would take him. To his surprise, Yvonne brought him right to his usual place.\nYvonne casually said, \"I've heard Steven mention it.\"\nNow that her emotions had calmed down, mentioning Steven's name didn't bother her much; she seemed completely unaffected by him now.\nReid found it amusing and got out of the car.\nYvonne got out of the car too, walked him to his front door, and then handed his keys back before looking down at her phone to call a ride.\nBut before she could dial, Reid took her phone away. He locked the screen, raised an eyebrow at her, and then opened the door. Yvonne paused for a moment, stood still, bit her lip, and then followed him inside.\nReid switched on the hallway light, casting a soft glow over her. In the light, her face looked even softer, her skin smooth and perfect, with a gentle warmth glowing from it.\nHer pressed lips now had a soft color, like a budding rose, showing a hint of defiance.\nReid moved closer to her. Yvonne tipped her head up slightly to look at him. He was tall, blocking out most of the light, like a looming predator.\nShe could feel the strong aura coming from him, the pressure making her heart beat faster without her control.\nHis eyes were deep and intense as if trying to see right through her. Feeling the gaze, Yvonne got a bit flustered and instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a wall behind her, so she had nowhere else to go.\nReid had no intention of stopping and kept moving closer until they were so near that they could feel each other's breath.\n\"Yvonne, do you know what it means to enter my house?\" Reid's voice was low, carrying an invisible pressure in the quiet space.\nHis eyes stayed focused on Yvonne, seeming to burn with a fiery intensity that was hard to understand. After a moment of silence, Yvonne sighed softly, as if she had made up her mind.\nShe stretched out her hand and pulled him closer. Her beautiful eyes looked into his, and she said quietly, \"You're right. Why should I keep myself for him—\"\n0:00 / 0:18\nWEBSITE.METRONOVEL.COM\n🔞🔞Click to read the full novel👉👉\nLearn more"
