        "primary_text": "Three months before the rejection, I applied for a transfer to the Crescent Moon Medical Center.\nOne month before the rejection, I mailed the rejection papers to Alpha Kane Ravencrest.\nThree days before the rejection, I packed all her belongings and moved out of The Ravencrest Pack.\nI decided to end the six-year bond when Kane appeared before me with his first love and her pup.\nThat was the moment my wolf finally howled the truth.\nSince he kept choosing them over me, his fated mate.\nI would set him free.\nWhen I truly vanished from his world, Kane's wolf went feral.\nI thought Kane would finally claim his first love as his new Luna.\nYet, surprisingly, this untouchable, powerful Alpha appeared before the media with bloodshot eyes, his voice breaking with raw vulnerability:\n\"I never betrayed our bond. I don't have any illegitimate pups. ‚Äù\n‚ÄúI just have a mate who left me. Her name is Aria Ashworth.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd my wolf is dying without her.\"\n\nThree months ago, the hospital director, Dr. Marcus Reed, held Aria's transfer application and looked at her in astonishment. \"Aria, are you certain about transferring to Crescent Moon Medical Center?\"\n\nAria's lashes fluttered as she smiled faintly, her expression tinged with the sorrow. \"I've made up my mind.\"\n\nHer wolf whimpered softly in her ch//est, sensing the finality in her decision.\n\nSeeing her determination, Marcus sighed and signed the paperwork.\n\nAs Aria left the director's office, she ran into Kane and Seraphina Cross in her white coat, with a little pup.\n\nShe paused in her tracks.\n\nThe scene before her could have been a perfect pack family portrait.\n\nSeraphina walked beside Kane, the boy beaming as he held both their hands.\n\nThe sight pierced Aria's heart like silver.\n\nKane's patience and tenderness toward them were things she'd never experienced, not even during their heat cycles.\n\nShe knew he resented their forced bond.\n\nSeraphina had been Kane's first love. Aria only learned they'd separated after she was bonded to Kane through a deal with his grandmother.\n\nTo Kane, she was the scheming wolf who'd stolen him away through manipulation. He never knew the truth‚Äîthat she'd met him long before Seraphina, though he didn't remember their first encounter under the blood moon.\n\nShe'd believed their mating bond would make him recall their past and win his heart.\n\nBut she was completely wrong.\n\nHe despised her with the fury of a caged Alpha.\n\nHow could love grow from such hatred?\n\nFor six years, he'd claimed to be unmated in public, pretending not to recognize her scent. The proof was undeniable.\n\n\"Dr. Ashworth?\" Seraphina greeted her.\n\nKane frowned, his amber eyes sharp as if warning Aria against revealing their bond.\n\nThe distance in his gaze sent a pang through her heart, but she maintained her composure. \"Ms. Cross. Alpha Ravencrest.\"\n\nThe formal address made Kane's jaw tighten almost imperceptibly.\n\nKane had recently become an investor in Silverstone Medical Center. Aria knew he hadn't done it for her, but for Seraphina.\n\nSeraphina's return from studying abroad, her immediate position at the hospital, and her appointment as head of surgery made his motives clear as moonlight.\n\nEveryone in the hospital knew she had Alpha Kane's backing, and the recent rumors that he was Seraphina's chosen mate had never been addressed by him.\n\nSeraphina looped her arm through Kane's with practiced ease. \"No need for formalities, Dr. Ashworth. At the hospital, you're a veteran, and I still have a lot to learn from you.\"\n\nBefore Aria could respond, the boy tugged at Kane. \"Alpha Daddy, I'm tired. Can you carry me? Please?\"\n\nAria's expression dramatically changed at the term \"Daddy\".\n\nSeraphina feigned scolding. \"Jasper, you can't call him that!\" She turned to Kane apologetically. \"I'm sorry. He doesn't know better.\"\n\nKane glanced at Aria briefly, before effortlessly lifting the boy with neutral efficiency. \"It's fine.\"\n\n\"I like you. I wish you were my real daddy!\" Raven Cross clung to Kane's neck.\n\nSeraphina tapped the boy's nose playfully. \"Silly boy.\"\n\nAria clenched her fists until her nails drew blood, the metallic scent sharp in the air.\n\nThis gentle, patient side of Kane was one she'd never known.\n\nAria decided not to dwell on it.\n\nShe wouldn't warm his heart anyway.\n\nPerhaps this was the Moon Goddess's way of setting her free.\n\nSwallowing her pain like bitter wolfsbane, she stepped past them into the elevator.\n\n***\n\nAria hadn't made her job transfer application public, nor had she told Kane, because she thought it was unnecessary.\n\nHe likely wouldn't care anyway. His wolf had never shown interest in her movements.\n\nHer car pulled up to Ravencrest Manor, where she rang the bell with hands that trembled slightly.\n\nIn no time, the housekeeper, Margaret Hayes, came out to open the door. \"Luna Aria, you're back.\"\n\n\"Is Elder Ravencrest home?\"\n\n\"Yes, she's inside. Please come in.\" Margaret treated Aria with utmost respect due to the Alpha's mate.\n\nKane's grandmother, Eleanor Ravencrest, was a highly respected elder in the Ravencrest pack. Since her mate's passing, Eleanor had been the true power behind the pack's affairs.\n\nEleanor was  born into a powerful pack that controlled vast territories. In her youth, she had been a formidable Luna and shrewd pack politician. Even if Kane's mother disliked Aria, she wouldn't dare cross Aria in Eleanor's presence.\n\nMargaret led Aria to the meditation room where Eleanor knelt on a cushion, praying to the Moon Goddess.\n\n\"Elder Ravencrest, Luna Aria is here.\"\n\nEleanor opened her eyes slowly, her wolf-sharp gaze assessing. \"Come sit.\"\n\nAfter Margaret left, Aria knelt beside Eleanor, bowing devoutly before the silver statue of the Moon Goddess.\n\n\"Elder Ravencrest,\" Aria began, her voice steady despite her racing heart, \"I want to sever our bond with Kane.\"\n\nEleanor froze momentarily before meeting her gaze. \"This wasn't our agreement when we made our deal. Are you having second thoughts?\"\n\nYes, she was.\n\nAria lowered her eyes, suppressing the bitterness in them. \"I've disappointed you.\"\n\nEleanor closed her eyes briefly and sighed. \"Well. If that's what you want, go ahead and end your bond with him. Since I gave you the opportunity, but you still couldn't win his heart. Now our pack owes you nothing more.\"\n\nA heavy weight settled in Aria's ch//est like stones in a river. \"Thank you,\" she replied hoarsely, her wolf whimpering at the finality.\n\n***\n\nReturning to Moonrise Apartments, she coincidentally encountered Seraphina, her son, and Kane downstairs.\n\nThey had arrived in Kane's black Porsche, the scent of his cologne still lingering in the evening air.\n\nAria stood frozen.\n\nSeraphina looked at her in surprise. \"Dr. Ashworth? Do you live at Moonrise Apartments too?\"\n\nInstinctively, Aria glanced at Kane, but he showed no reaction.\n\nHis coldness cut deeper than silver claws.\n\nMoonrise Apartments was a luxury complex in Boston, one of the Ravencrest pack's properties. Kane had offered it to her as compensation for their forced bond.\n\nIt was close to the hospital, so she accepted it.\n\nShe never imagined he would move Seraphina and her son here as well.\n\nHow eager his wolf must be.\n\n\"What a coincidence,\" Aria murmured, suppressing her emotions.\n\nAs she turned to leave, Seraphina spoke again. \"Dr. Ashworth, I heard you're mated. Why haven't we seen your mate around?\"\n\nAria's steps faltered.\n\nHer gaze flickered to Kane, whose amber eyes darkened with displeasure.\n\nAria sneered inwardly. Was he really that afraid of Seraphina finding out about their mating bond?\n\n\"I don't have a mate,\" she stated flatly.\n\nA shadow passed through Kane's normally controlled eyes.\n\n\"But Dr. Ashworth, your records list you as mated,\" Seraphina said, her smile still in place but her eyes sharp as a blade.\n\nHer hospital records did indeed list her as bonded. Yet no one had ever seen her supposed mate.\n\nAria forced a mocking smile. \"I just wrote that for fun. I don't have a mate.\"\n\nKane's eyes narrowed dangerously at her denial.\n\nSince she'd already decided to leave, she didn't care anymore about keeping her mating status a secret.\n\nWithout another glance at the group behind her, Aria strode into the apartment building.\n\nIn the evening, Aria packed all her personal belongings into two large suitcases and stored them in the walk-in closet.\n\nHer gaze fell on the photo frame of their mating ceremony, in which she was wearing a white dress, holding Kane's hand, smiling beautifully, in stark contrast to his cold, serious face.\n\nBack then, she'd simply thought he just didn't like showing emotion. Though it was their only photo together as bonded mates, she'd treasured it.\n\nBut now, it just seemed like a mockery of the Moon Goddess's gift.\n\nIt wasn't that he disliked showing warmth. She just hadn't been worthy of his smiles.\n\nPicking up the photo for one last look, she tossed it into a cardboard box with other discarded items, sealing them away in the closet.\n\nAs she exited the bedroom, sounds and familiar scent from the living room caught her attention. Kane had returned.\n\nEntering the living area, she saw him hanging his coat on the entryway rack and changing his shoes.\n\nAria took a deep breath and approached him.\n\n\"Don't you have any explanation for today?\" she asked, referring to his decision to move Seraphina and her son into Moonrise Apartments, too.\n\nKane removed his tie, his amber eyes cold. \"Explain what?\"\n\n\"The apartments are close to the hospital. If you can live there, why can't they?\"\n\nHe draped the tie over his arm and stared at her. \"Aria, you got what you wanted. Don't be petty.\"\n\nAria was devastated by his words. Her wolf whimpering inside.\n\nGot what she wanted?\n\nIn his eyes, she had already obtained the position of Luna. Any objection to Seraphina and her son moving in must seem like petty jealousy to him.\n\nAs he turned toward the bedroom, Aria stopped him. \"We need to talk.\"\n\nKane paused and turned back impatiently, his gaze indifferent. \"What now?\"\n\n\"Let's sever our bond.\" Aria slowly removed her Luna ring and clenched it in her palm. \"I'm setting you free.\"\n\n„Äê7014„Äë",

        "primary_text": "\"He finally remembered the woman waiting for him at home, only to face her divorce papers. Confident she'd regret it, he signed. But post-divorce, she blossomed, turning heads everywhere. Defeated, he begged to win her back!\n=====\nIn the bustling, weathered heart of Orkset, flames erupted violently within an ancient apartment building. Propelled by gusts of wind, the fire devoured the structure, belching dense smoke and bright, searing tongues of flame.\n\n\"Saved! They've been saved.\" The words echoed amidst the chaos.\n\nFirefighters emerged from the smoldering inferno, carrying Carrie Campbell to safety at the roadside.\n\nHer features, usually refined and expressive, were now smeared with soot; her sparkling eyes dimmed to a vacant gaze, hollow and lost.\n\nAs reality seeped back into her consciousness, Carrie felt a rush of gratitude overpower her usual composure. Her voice, hoarse and weak, conveyed a profound \"thank you\" to her rescuers. Shaking, she fumbled for her phone, her fingertips quivering as they found the familiar number.\n\n\"Hello, the person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe automated message played after a few rings, leaving her with a lump in her throat, her unvoiced frustrations and sorrow welling up inside her.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a deafening roar, the explosion abruptly silenced the cold, mechanical voice echoing through the line. Carrie's head snapped upwards, shock painted on her face as she witnessed the apartment she had just exited erupt into flames.\n\nChunks of debris were hurled into the air by the force of the blast, scattering across the sky.\n\nPanic engulfed the crowd as survivors, freshly rescued, screamed in terror. They huddled together, seeking solace in each other's arms, their cries piercing the tumultuous scene. In stark contrast, Carrie lay alone on a stretcher, her isolation magnified amidst the chaos.\n\n\"Kristopher...\" Fighting the dread creeping up her spine, Carrie pressed her lips together tightly and dialed her husband's number again, her resolve unwavering.\n\nYet, the call disconnected after a few short rings, leaving her with a haunting silence.\n\nJust then, a Twitter notification flickered on her phone screen.\n\nThe gossip feed was alive with the latest gossip: #LiseNash #MysteriouBoyfriend.\n\nAccording to the tweet, a producer from a well-known variety show had invited the renowned star Lise Nash to a dinner, which had quickly soured when she declined to partake in a toast.\n\nThis act of defiance had sparked a confrontation, only to be interrupted by Lise's domineering boyfriend. He stormed into the private dining room, dismissing the producer with a dismissive wave and escorting Lise away.\n\nThe tweet described the scene vividly, painting a picture of a powerful man defending his beloved partner.\n\nYet, perhaps due to his prominence, only the back of the man was visible in the accompanying photos, preserving his anonymity. Meanwhile, Lise, donning an oversized suit jacket, beamed a smile, reaching out to clasp his hand as they departed together.\n\nCarrie's eyes were glued to the screen, her stare intense and unblinking as she absorbed the image before her.\n\nThere he was--Kristopher Norris!\n\nThe suit jacket draped carelessly over Lise was a dead giveaway.\n\nEvery piece of clothing Kristopher owned had been meticulously tailored by a master craftsman abroad, a detail Carrie knew all too well.\n\nHer grip on her phone tightened, her knuckles blanching to a stark white, as if her very soul were being squeezed by an invisible hand, the pain sharp and acid-like in its intensity.\n\nIn her most desperate moment, Kristopher had coldly disconnected their call, choosing instead to be at Lise's side.\n\nWhat was the worth of their two-year marriage?\n\nThe tears she had been holding back now overwhelmed her, streaming down her face.\n\nEven as she tilted her head back in a futile attempt to stem the flow, the tears continued to escape.\n\nLise had always been Kristopher's first love, a fact whispered and gossiped about among their circles. The Norris family had never approved of Lise, seeing her ordinary background as unfitting.\n\nForced apart by family pressures, it had been Lise who ended things, but the past, it seemed, was not easily left behind.\n\nKristopher had diligently pursued the leadership of the Norris family, harboring dreams of finally being with Lise.\n\nYet, when he reached his goal, he discovered that Lise had already chosen another.\n\nIn defiance of his family's expectations and perhaps out of bitterness, Kristopher turned to Carrie, a woman equally devoid of wealth or status, to become Mrs. Norris, thereby blocking any matchmaking attempts by his relatives.\n\nAt that time, Carrie faced immense pressure from her father, Tristan Campbell, who was pushing her towards a marriage with a playboy, the son of a business associate, to cover her grandmother's steep medical expenses.\n\nBoth Kristopher and Carrie, driven by their personal motives, consented to a marriage of convenience.\n\nOriginally set for just one year, their contractual marriage stretched beyond its term, sustained by a shared understanding between them.\n\nOver time, Carrie began to believe in the authenticity of their union, never suspecting that it was merely an extension of her hopes.\n\nJust moments ago, a fire had nearly claimed Carrie's life. In that critical moment, she reached out to Kristopher, only to be twice rebuffed as he spent his time with Lise.\n\nThis harsh reality shattered Carrie's illusions, revealing that her perceived transition from pretense to genuine relationship was nothing but a facade maintained by her own desires.\n\nCarrie wasn't even a temporary substitute in Kristopher's life but merely a pawn used to spite his family.\n\nAfter a poignant pause, tears welled up in Carrie's eyes, unstoppable and poignant.\n\nIt might be time for her to release herself from the shackles of her own hopeful delusions--to stop deceiving herself.\n\nChapter 2 Trending Topics\nThe overwhelming number of injuries from the fire was staggering, straining the already frantic doctors and nurses as they tried to provide aid.\n\nCarrie had been merely grazed by a splintered clothes rack, which left a deep, jagged wound on her calf. In comparison to the chaos around her, her wounds seemed almost negligible.\n\nShe managed to get basic care--a brisk cleaning and a quick wrap of bandages--at a local hospital before catching a cab back to her house.\n\nBayview Villa, a grand property under Kristopher's name, was technically their matrimonial residence.\n\nLiving alone had become the norm for Carrie, as Kristopher was hardly ever around. She had bid farewell to the housekeeper, discovering that her life could be quite adequately maintained with just takeout, deliveries, and the occasional visit from a part-time cleaner.\n\nNow, she found herself the sole occupant of the sprawling living room, sinking into the sofa, her gaze drifting across the empty space.\n\nThe stark, monochrome decor did nothing to imbue warmth into the atmosphere.\n\nA chilling realization crept up on her: this vast, elegant space felt more like a colossal tomb, a silent grave for her lost years of youth and a love that had quietly slipped away.\n\nIn this cold, echoing house, would anyone even notice if her breath ceased one day?\n\nCarrie exhaled a weary sigh, her frame heavy as she leaned against the cold wall for support, struggling up the stairs to her bedroom on the second floor.\n\nEach step was a battle, sending stabbing pains shooting through her from the surface of her skin down to her aching bones.\n\nThe house, stark and hollow, echoed even the smallest sounds, magnifying her sense of isolation.\n\nIt was today, amidst this profound silence, that Carrie truly grasped the all-encompassing nature of her loneliness--it was almost tangible, enveloping her senses with its texture and mournful whispers, tightening around her heart like a vice, producing a dull, relentless ache.\n\nUpon reaching the sanctuary of her bedroom, she collapsed onto the bed, the very embodiment of exhaustion, feeling it both physically and spiritually.\n\nJust as she surrendered to this weariness, the sharp ring of the phone pierced the silence.\n\n\"You reached out to me earlier. What do you need?\" Kristopher's voice cut through the line, cold and distant as ever.\n\nCarrie was caught off guard by his unexpected call. Words failed her as she parted her lips to respond, but before she could collect her thoughts, a soft, feminine voice floated through from the other end. \"Kristopher, will you join me to...\"\n\nA surge of emotions tightened Carrie's grip on the phone, her heart thumping louder with each second. Overwhelmed and unable to contain her rising panic, she demanded, \"Who's there with you?\"\n\nKristopher gave no answer, merely stating in a flat, disinterested voice, \"If there's something you need, let's catch up when I'm back. I have pressing engagements right now, so I must disconnect.\"\n\nHe promptly ended the call, cutting off any chance for Carrie to reply.\n\nAs the harsh beep of the disconnected line filled her ears, Carrie's lips twisted into a rueful grin. How utterly foolish she felt! Deep down, she knew his response all too well, yet she had clung to the hope of hearing his voice confirm it.\n\nWith a sense of self-inflicted irony, Carrie activated her tablet and scrolled through the day's hot topics.\n\nOne headline caught her eye: \"A female star shielded from harassment at a dinner by her formidable partner.\" A wry smile twisted her lips.\n\nCarrie knew all too well what it was like to face harassment at those kinds of dinners.\n\nShe vividly remembered her first major audition after her entering the showbiz; her agent had escorted her to a dinner with the influential director and producer of the drama series \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nAs a novice in the dizzying world of showbiz, Carrie had felt incredibly vulnerable, uncertain of how to navigate the murky waters of such gatherings.\n\nThe producer had eyed her shamelessly, sneering as he asked, \"Is this the new talent you're introducing? She appears presentable, but I'm curious to see how she fares with a drink. Here's the deal, if you can gulp down this bottle in one go, I'll secure you an audition for the lead role.\"\n\nCarrie was inclined to decline, but under the relentless pressure from her agent, she found herself compelled to consume the entire bottle.\n\nAs the evening wore on, she was hurriedly taken to the hospital suffering from a severe stomach ailment.\n\nHer agent, fretful about the prospect of the role slipping away to another, quickly settled the hospital charges and departed.\n\nAt that time, Carrie found herself isolated in a hospital bed for several long days.\n\nYet, even before Carrie could be released from the hospital, the media was abuzz with the announcement that Lise had secured the lead role in \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nSubsequently, her agent rebuked Carrie for her lack of ambition, complaining, \"You are more appealing than Lise, so why can't you show more drive? She cozied up to Mr. Norris and hardly had to make an effort. She's surrounded by people eager to cater to her every need. I've heard that Mr. Norris personally orchestrated her landing the lead role in this production!\"\n\nWhen the show premiered, Lise was catapulted into stardom, swiftly ascending to the elite echelons of the acting world.\n\nFrom that moment forward, Carrie let her acting aspirations wane and chose instead to devote herself entirely to supporting her husband, Kristopher.\n\nAfter all, no matter her efforts, she could never get the same career opportunities that Lise seemed to receive effortlessly with Kristopher's offhand remarks.\n\nAt that time, Carrie had believed she was filling the role that was meant to be Lise's as Mrs. Norris, which meant she owed Lise.\n\nBy giving up the career opportunities to Lise, Carrie thought they would settle their unspoken debt.\n\nHowever, Carrie hadn't foreseen that Lise would claim both the coveted career and Kristopher's affections.\n\nAs Lise's professional and love life blossomed, Carrie came to the painful realization that she had been overly consumed with her romantic pursuits, at the expense of her career, and now, she found herself bereft of both love and professional fulfillment.\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Carrie viewed her past two years as tragically misguided.\n\nGiven another opportunity, she resolved she wouldn't be so unguarded, letting her heart recklessly fall captive to Kristopher's charm.\n\n\"Ms. Spencer, the new copyright contract is prepared. Please review it for any discrepancies.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed with the alert, snapping Carrie out of her reverie. She gazed at the PDF file attached in the message, her mind briefly overwhelmed.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Katrina Spencer, Carrie had once made a name for herself as a budding screenwriter, selling numerous scripts in her early days.\n\nDuring her early career as Katrina, Carrie often sold her work for a pittance, compelled by her urgent need for immediate cash.\n\nOver the years, these scripts transformed into blockbuster films and hit series, catapulting Katrina's reputation to new heights.\n\nBy this time, Carrie had married Kristopher and was no longer plagued by the financial woes that had once driven her to desperation--her grandmother's hefty medical bills were a thing of the past. With her financial crises resolved, Carrie's life had pivoted to domestic responsibilities, striving to be an exemplary wife to Kristopher. Amidst these changes, her pseudonym, Katrina Spencer, gradually receded into the background.\n\nHowever, her past as Katrina wasn't ready to be shelved just yet. Recently, an interested buyer had come forward, ready to pay a handsome sum for one of her old scripts.\n\nCarrie, however, was hesitant to sell. She raised several concerns about the contract presented to her, and to her astonishment, the buyer was genuine enough to revise it accordingly.\n\nHolding the revised contract in her hands, Carrie inhaled deeply, her resolve hardening. She seemed to have reached a crucial decision.\n\nHer fingers danced over her phone's keyboard with swift precision, typing out a firm command. \"Create a divorce agreement following my terms and ensure it reaches Kristopher Norris at the Norris Group.\"\n\nWithout pausing for a response, she placed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step echoing a blend of determination and newfound independence.\n\nChapter 3 Exchange Of Conveniences\nThirty minutes had passed, Carrie finally heaved herself up from the bathtub, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. As she lifted her gaze, her own image in the mirror halted her movements--her skin appeared as smooth and impeccable as fine porcelain, glowing with an unblemished radiance.\n\nHer eyes, deep pools of allure, sparkled with an enchanting, soft warmth, inviting anyone who dared meet her gaze.\n\nDespite edging into her late twenties at twenty-five, she reveled in the fact that time had yet to etch its marks upon her flawless complexion.\n\nSurely, a woman with such a visage had no place for self-pity.\n\nAbsorbed in her contemplation, Carrie carelessly extended her right leg onto the cold floor, forgetting it was the very limb she had injured. Wrapped excessively in cling film to shield it from moisture, the tight encasement had stifled her circulation, rendering her leg eerily numb. As her foot touched down, it betrayed her, slipping forward unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Carrie gasped, her arms flailing in a frantic ballet, searching for a lifeline in the void.\n\nJust as she teetered on the brink of a painful rendezvous with the floor, the bathroom door burst open.\n\nKristopher stood at the entrance, his suit immaculately tailored, creating a striking figure. As their eyes locked, he paused, visibly taken aback, then quickly closed the distance with brisk strides.\n\nCarrie's breath caught as Kristopher swept her up in a graceful bridal style, an unexpected tightness wrapping around her waist. Caught off guard by his sudden appearance, Carrie realized with a jolt that she was completely bare. A flush of embarrassment washed over her as she instinctively clutched her hands over her chest.\n\nThis was their first moment of such intimacy since their wedding, and the discomfort made her toes curl inward, her skin blushing a delicate shade of pink.\n\nKristopher looked down at her with a mischievous grin. \"Let's be honest, there's not much to see,\" he teased gently.\n\nFeeling both mortified and slightly irritated, Carrie snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Norris, after all you've seen, I suppose nothing can impress you anymore.\"\n\nShe carried her C-cup curves with understated charm, a touch of sensuality that outshone Lise's painfully flat, almost awkwardly rigid build.\n\nYet Carrie knew well that without love, even the most perfect physique paled in comparison to the charm of one dearly cherished.\n\nNonchalantly, Kristopher reached for a bathrobe hanging behind the door and draped it over her. His frown deepened at her comment. \"What are you talking about, Carrie?\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike him, and his expression grew even more impatient. \"Tell me, did you send those divorce papers in the dead of night just to lure me back here--to catch you completely bare?\" His tone was a mix of disbelief and annoyance. \"I told you I was swamped with work. Was this dramatic display really necessary?\"\n\nCarrie's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the tension between them. He was always so quick to lose patience with her.\n\nShe wasn't the type to throw around words like divorce or breakups lightly. In fact, this was the first time she'd ever mentioned divorce in their two-year marriage, yet he seemed indifferent to her turmoil. He simply dismissed her concerns as if she were overreacting about trivial matters.\n\nDespite the throbbing pain in her leg, Carrie mustered her strength and said, \"Put me down.\"\n\nKristopher, however, paid no heed, his eyes scanning her leg swathed in bandages. His brow furrowed slightly. \"What happened to your leg? Is this some elaborate ploy to lure me back?\"\n\nAt his words, a bitter laugh escaped Carrie.\n\nIt seemed he viewed her as merely seeking attention, and in failing to capture it, she had likely concocted a story to draw him back, allowing her to dramatize her plight in his presence.\n\nWith a blank face, she replied untruthfully, \"It's a beauty treatment that shouldn't get wet.\"\n\n\"Why did you suddenly decide to undergo such a treatment?\" Kristopher inquired, his tone casual as he carried her outside, not pressing the issue further.\n\nHis frame was large, and through his thin shirt, she could distinctly feel the warmth of his body and the defined shape of his chest muscles.\n\nThe closeness created an uncomfortable tension for Carrie, who had resolved to end things once and for all.\n\nHer voice climbed involuntarily, sharper this time. \"Oh, since when have you been concerned with such minor things, Mr. Norris?\"\n\nFor the first time, Kristopher witnessed her using biting sarcasm; it struck him as peculiarly amusing. With a calm demeanor, he responded, \"You're my wife, it's only natural I'd be concerned about your well-being.\"\n\n\"Really?\" There was a somber note in Carrie's voice now. \"It seems like you've never really regarded me as your wife. I'm scared that if I were to die, you wouldn't even know until much later.\"\n\nAfter all, at that very moment, Kristopher had been distracted, lost in moments with his first love, too consumed to lend an ear to her desperate pleas.\n\nCaught off guard by her accusation, Kristopher's eyes widened with surprise before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. \"Carrie, what's brought on this sudden outburst of anger? Just because I was tied up this afternoon and missed your call? Perhaps I've been too indulgent with you lately, and it's made you a bit too presumptuous?\"\n\nCarrie froze, startled. Was he accusing her of being too presumptuous?\n\nShe realized their marriage had always been lopsided. In his eyes, she was nothing more than a transactional partner, a woman who had bartered her freedom for financial security.\n\nTheir union was meant to be a mere exchange of conveniences, yet she had, quite foolishly, fallen deeply in love with him.\n\nIn the tricky terrain of romance, the one who fell first invariably found themselves at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nKristopher's dismissive reaction left Carrie reeling, her emotions dismissed as trifles, a tight knot of suffocation rising in her chest.\n\n\"I said to put me down this instant!\" Carrie exclaimed, jerking her head to the side, her voice laced with a sharp edge of impatience.\n\nKristopher remained mute, effortlessly carrying her towards the bed before suddenly releasing his hold.\n\nCarrie felt a jolt as the support vanished, her heart skipping a beat as she instinctively grasped for him.\n\nTheir bodies collided on the bed, her bathrobe teetering on the brink of decency, threatening to unravel with any minor shift.\n\nPropped on one elbow, Kristopher gazed down at her, his lips curled into a sly, teasing grin. \"You wanted to be let go, didn't you? So why cling to me now?\"\n\nHis eyes, deep and sparkling like a midnight lake speckled with stars, captivated her.\n\nIn those celestial depths, Carrie caught a glimpse of her own reflection.\n\nAt times like this, she was misled into believing he harbored a deep affection.\n\nSadly, his heart was a fortress reserved for Lise, and all Carrie had left were empty fantasies.\n\n\"Boring!\" she exclaimed, her voice devoid of any enthusiasm as she attempted to rise, her hand inadvertently brushing against something unexpected.\n\nThe following moment brought a noticeable shift in his cock pressing against her stomach.\n\n\"Don't move, or I can't promise what might happen next,\" he warned in a deep, gravelly voice.\n\nWith a frown, Carrie internally cursed upon hearing the statement.\n\nIt was an undeniable fact. Primal instincts steered the actions of men. Absence of affection didn't quell their basic desires.\n\nYet, she dared not agitate Kristopher. Angling her face away, her body remained rigid, frozen in place.\n\nCarrie, feeling irked, shot back. \"Didn't you say there's nothing here to see? What's with the reaction now, Mr. Norris? Are you really that easy to impress?\"\n\nNo sooner had her words flown than she grasped the potential repercussions of her sharp tongue.\n\nA wave of regret surged through Carrie, but instead of anger, Kristopher responded with a chuckle, \"You are my wife, after all. Since that's something I can't alter, I might as well embrace it. Besides, it's been years since we became husband and wife--it would be a shame to neglect you completely.\"\n\nChapter 4 Are You Out Of Your Mind?\nKristopher slipped his hand beneath the folds of her bathrobe, his touch tracing the curve of Carrie's skin, as smooth and delicate as silk. He encircled her slender waist, drawing her closer with a gentle yet firm grip.\n\nHer face, a captivating canvas of defiance and visible irritation, ignited in him an uncontrollable urge to claim victory over her resistance.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy, yet he remained composed, slowly removing his tailored suit.\n\nThe fabric of his suit brushed lightly against Carrie's cheek, releasing a mix of scents: a familiar woody aroma intertwined with an unexpected zesty twist of lemon. It was unmistakably Jo Malone's Blue Agava and Cacao--Lise's signature scent.\n\nA surge of nausea overwhelmed Carrie at the realization.\n\nAs Kristopher's eyes, now shaded with a stormy intensity, drew nearer to hers, the proximity conjured unwelcome visions of him with Lise. Her stomach churned violently, and with a sudden movement, she pushed him away, propping herself up with a jolt and a dry retch.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer stomach had been empty all day, leaving her with nothing to bring up.\n\nThe desire in Kristopher's gaze flickered out, replaced by a cold, detached expression as he withdrew slightly.\n\nObserving the genuine distress and the reddening of Carrie's eyes, Kristopher perceived her reaction for outright disgust at their closeness.\n\nHe paused, fingers adjusting his shirt cuffs, his voice cold as he confronted her. \"Carrie, is this reaction reserved only for me, or is it how you respond to all men?\"\n\nThe air in the room turned frosty, thick with tension.\n\nCarrie swallowed the sharp sting in her throat, her eyes widening in shock as she stared up at him.\n\nEver since their marriage, she had cut ties with nearly all her male friends, yet here was Kristopher, casually tossing out comments sharp enough to cut glass.\n\nThe years of love she had poured into their relationship now seemed utterly futile.\n\nHeat crept up her neck, coloring her cheeks a bright scarlet as indignation took hold. Without thinking, her hand flew up and delivered a stinging slap across Kristopher's face.\n\nAll her suppressed grievances from the day ignited in that swift motion.\n\nHer bathrobe, loosened in the heat of the moment, slipped from her shoulders. Ignoring the flush of exposure, she swiftly gathered the fabric and draped it around herself, her movements quick and firm.\n\nThe impact of her slap had left a light, crimson mark on Kristopher's cheek, marking him with her outrage.\n\nHis eyes, wide with disbelief, met hers. \"Carrie, are you out of your mind?\"\n\nOut of her mind? Yes, she was clearly insane to ever fall for him in the first place.\n\nCarrie fumed silently, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nSuddenly, the sharp buzz of the phone on the table cut through the mounting tension, its vibration bringing a brief respite from their standoff.\n\nKristopher cast a fleeting glance at the message, shut off the phone with a snap, and strode towards the door, his back rigid with tension.\n\nHer voice, firm and unwavering, chased after him. \"We're getting a divorce! Make sure you sign those papers before you walk out that door!\"\n\nKristopher paused briefly and said sharply, \"I have something to do now. When I return, do whatever pleases you.\" With that, he forcefully shut the door.\n\nCarrie's eyes followed his unwavering exit, feeling an oppressive weight compressing her chest once again.\n\nShe disregarded the sharp sting in her leg and hobbled determinedly toward her tablet. Fingers trembling, she hastily navigated to Lise's Twitter page.\n\nLise had just uploaded a new tweet.\n\nThe photo showed her lying down with a fever patch adhered to her forehead, still enveloped in Kristopher's familiar jacket.\n\nThe caption read, \"Being sick makes me extra clingy. Wishing I had someone here. Stay cozy and take care, everyone!\"\n\nThe simultaneous timing of these two events made it almost impossible for Carrie not to suspect that Kristopher had dashed off to tend to Lise.\n\nCarrie's instincts loudly proclaimed that this was no accident; Lise had deliberately sought to tug at Kristopher's heartstrings. It appeared her tactics were effective.\n\nNot even Carrie's stark threat of divorce could overshadow Lise's theatrical display of vulnerability.\n\nSeething with fury, Carrie quaked like a leaf swept into a storm.\n\nShe steeled herself against the heartache, forcefully ripping the plastic wrap from her aching leg.\n\nAfter her lengthy soak, the bath's lingering moisture had infiltrated her skin, inflaming the wound until it was a vivid, angry red and painfully swollen.\n\nShe, too, could be clingy. Even in the harshest times back in the county, she had shown vulnerability, breaking down into soft sobs within the comforting arms of her grandmother, especially that one time she got burned by the scalding kettle.\n\nBut such vulnerability had its time and place, and it wasn't now.\n\nThe stark reality of Kristopher's exit forced Carrie to confront her need for self-reliance.\n\nBiting down hard on her lip, Carrie cleaned the throbbing wound with a practiced hand before securely wrapping it anew.\n\nShe rose with a newfound resolve and yanked a black suitcase from the far end of her expansive walk-in closet--it held all the belongings she'd brought into this house as a hopeful bride.\n\nShe grabbed a fresh set of clothes to slip into and left a bank card neatly on the bedside table.\n\nShe had transferred every penny she'd earned over the past year onto that card, effectively settling her financial entanglements with Kristopher over the last two years and cutting him out of her life for good.\n\nDragging the heavy suitcase behind her, she limped painfully out of the opulent villa.\n\nAs she passed through the gate, she wrapped her baseball jacket more tightly around her slight figure, her silhouette hauntingly solitary in the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe night air of early spring was bitingly cold, devoid of any trace of warmth, a chill that seemed almost faint compared to the ice forming in Carrie's shattered heart.\n\nShe had arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a heart full of dreams, and now she was leaving, dreams crumbled, utterly alone.\n\nA bitter laugh slipped through her lips. If only she hadn't fallen so hard for him, if only she'd proposed an amicable separation at the end of their agreed year, maybe she wouldn't be wandering now, a lost soul in the shadow of her former self.\n\nLise didn't have to lift a finger, and Carrie had already fallen, utterly broken and beyond redemption.\n\nChapter 5 A Gathering\nMeanwhile, in the Oasis Club, renowned as the priciest spot in Orkset, the air within the VIP room crackled with excitement. Under the spell of bright lights and thumping music, a diverse group of men and women lounged together, basking in the exclusivity of the setting.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, revealing Kristopher in the doorway.\n\nThe karaoke session halted abruptly as the crowd turned to greet him in unison, voices mingling. \"Kristopher...\"\n\nBefore they could utter another word, a woman cloaked from head to toe stepped out from behind him.\n\nLise, with a fluid motion, removed her mask and slid her arm through Kristopher's. She addressed the room with a poised charm. \"My assistant took a sudden leave, and I found myself without company. Not keen on spending the evening alone, I invited Kristopher to join me. I trust that's alright?\"\n\nLise's beauty was without question. Her face was a delicate composition of cherry lips and a sculpted nose, framed by eyes that shimmered with a vulnerable allure, commanding a protective fervor from those around her--her presence, ethereal.\n\nIn contrast, Carrie's features were more pronounced, her beauty vivid and striking. Lise, by comparison, carried a softer, more understated elegance.\n\nYet, as it often goes, matters of the heart followed no simple paths.\n\nWhile Kristopher and Carrie were married, it was in name only; Kristopher seemed detached and seldom included her in private social events.\n\nThe group didn't have much of a relationship with Carrie, leading them to feel no obligation to defend her.\n\nUpon hearing Lise's comment, a moment of discomfort rippled through the air. Nonetheless, they quickly recovered, offering a congenial smile as they said, \"We're all friends here; let's not bother with formalities.\"\n\nLise offered a subtle, knowing smile, as she gracefully accompanied Kristopher into the bustling room.\n\nThe event that evening had been meticulously planned to express appreciation for Kristopher's contributions.\n\nAs they stepped into the room, the crowd parted like the sea, making way for them to proceed to the seats of honor.\n\nThe group's leader handed Kristopher a glass of wine with a flourish, proclaiming with a broad grin, \"We truly owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Norris! Your exceptional talents are the talk of the town, and witnessing them firsthand today only confirms it. Without your expertise, securing this contract would have been a fantasy!\"\n\nTheir gathering marked the launch of a novel shopping platform, one that had been in negotiation with numerous local brands in Orkset. But the scenario changed dramatically when the tech giant JoyBuy dramatically entered the scene, stirring up the competitive landscape.\n\nCompeting with JoyBuy was akin to the classic David versus Goliath tale--hopelessly daunting. In a surge of desperation, they turned to Kristopher, reaching out through a network of connections for his renowned strategic prowess.\n\nWith his characteristic swiftness, Kristopher hatched an ingenious plan and swiftly secured the deal, snatching it from the clutches of JoyBuy right before the business association could ink their agreement--a masterful coup that reverberated success.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround only intensified the already deep respect everyone held for Kristopher.\n\nAlbin Murray, beaming with pride, couldn't help but boast, \"Ah, just look at the caliber of his friends! They thought they could steal deals right under our noses, obviously underestimating Kristopher's clout!\"\n\nAlbin, born into the wealthy Murray family, counted himself among Kristopher's closest friends. He was renowned for his sprawling social web--a network through which the desperate plea for help was channeled to Kristopher.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristopher himself, the focus of all their discussions, reclined nonchalantly on the couch, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe was well-versed in the art of receiving compliments; thus, his expression stayed calm and detached.\n\nThe ambient light sculpted his angular features, casting dramatic shadows that emphasized his high nose bridge and sharply cut jawline, as though he were a living masterpiece.\n\nHis natural grace and detachment eclipsed any terrestrial magnificence.\n\nFollowing a sequence of celebratory toasts, when it became apparent that Kristopher merely touched his glass without truly drinking, the rest of the company toned down their conversation, allowing him a moment of repose with his eyes gently shut.\n\nLise, slightly feverish, opted not to indulge in the spirits, choosing instead to sit in serene silence next to Kristopher, her eyes lingering on him with a look of deep, unmistakable adoration.\n\nAlbin, captivated by the seemingly perfect pair, pondered the whims of destiny. He discreetly captured their image with his smartphone and nonchalantly shared it across his social networks.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the liquor dwindled, the room's door swung open anew.\n\nKristopher's personal assistant, Oliver Brooks, made his entrance, acknowledging the gathering with a courteous nod that bordered on respect but avoided groveling, swiftly positioning himself in front of Kristopher.\n\nSilence hung in the air, yet Lise, unable to contain her curiosity, leaned in and whispered, \"What's going on?\"\n\nOliver, maintaining his focus on Kristopher, chose not to respond directly to her.\n\nA flush of embarrassment tinted Lise's cheeks as she turned towards Kristopher, hesitatingly inquiring, \"Should I leave?\"\n\nKristopher adjusted his posture, his voice low and calm as he instructed, \"Go ahead, speak.\"\n\nA shiver of apprehension coursed through Oliver as he tentatively began, \"Mr. Norris, Mrs. Norris has departed from Bayview Villa, and...\"\n\n&9&\n0:00 / 4:50",

        "primary_text": "\"He finally remembered the woman waiting for him at home, only to face her divorce papers. Confident she'd regret it, he signed. But post-divorce, she blossomed, turning heads everywhere. Defeated, he begged to win her back!\n=====\nIn the bustling, weathered heart of Orkset, flames erupted violently within an ancient apartment building. Propelled by gusts of wind, the fire devoured the structure, belching dense smoke and bright, searing tongues of flame.\n\n\"Saved! They've been saved.\" The words echoed amidst the chaos.\n\nFirefighters emerged from the smoldering inferno, carrying Carrie Campbell to safety at the roadside.\n\nHer features, usually refined and expressive, were now smeared with soot; her sparkling eyes dimmed to a vacant gaze, hollow and lost.\n\nAs reality seeped back into her consciousness, Carrie felt a rush of gratitude overpower her usual composure. Her voice, hoarse and weak, conveyed a profound \"thank you\" to her rescuers. Shaking, she fumbled for her phone, her fingertips quivering as they found the familiar number.\n\n\"Hello, the person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe automated message played after a few rings, leaving her with a lump in her throat, her unvoiced frustrations and sorrow welling up inside her.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a deafening roar, the explosion abruptly silenced the cold, mechanical voice echoing through the line. Carrie's head snapped upwards, shock painted on her face as she witnessed the apartment she had just exited erupt into flames.\n\nChunks of debris were hurled into the air by the force of the blast, scattering across the sky.\n\nPanic engulfed the crowd as survivors, freshly rescued, screamed in terror. They huddled together, seeking solace in each other's arms, their cries piercing the tumultuous scene. In stark contrast, Carrie lay alone on a stretcher, her isolation magnified amidst the chaos.\n\n\"Kristopher...\" Fighting the dread creeping up her spine, Carrie pressed her lips together tightly and dialed her husband's number again, her resolve unwavering.\n\nYet, the call disconnected after a few short rings, leaving her with a haunting silence.\n\nJust then, a Twitter notification flickered on her phone screen.\n\nThe gossip feed was alive with the latest gossip: #LiseNash #MysteriouBoyfriend.\n\nAccording to the tweet, a producer from a well-known variety show had invited the renowned star Lise Nash to a dinner, which had quickly soured when she declined to partake in a toast.\n\nThis act of defiance had sparked a confrontation, only to be interrupted by Lise's domineering boyfriend. He stormed into the private dining room, dismissing the producer with a dismissive wave and escorting Lise away.\n\nThe tweet described the scene vividly, painting a picture of a powerful man defending his beloved partner.\n\nYet, perhaps due to his prominence, only the back of the man was visible in the accompanying photos, preserving his anonymity. Meanwhile, Lise, donning an oversized suit jacket, beamed a smile, reaching out to clasp his hand as they departed together.\n\nCarrie's eyes were glued to the screen, her stare intense and unblinking as she absorbed the image before her.\n\nThere he was--Kristopher Norris!\n\nThe suit jacket draped carelessly over Lise was a dead giveaway.\n\nEvery piece of clothing Kristopher owned had been meticulously tailored by a master craftsman abroad, a detail Carrie knew all too well.\n\nHer grip on her phone tightened, her knuckles blanching to a stark white, as if her very soul were being squeezed by an invisible hand, the pain sharp and acid-like in its intensity.\n\nIn her most desperate moment, Kristopher had coldly disconnected their call, choosing instead to be at Lise's side.\n\nWhat was the worth of their two-year marriage?\n\nThe tears she had been holding back now overwhelmed her, streaming down her face.\n\nEven as she tilted her head back in a futile attempt to stem the flow, the tears continued to escape.\n\nLise had always been Kristopher's first love, a fact whispered and gossiped about among their circles. The Norris family had never approved of Lise, seeing her ordinary background as unfitting.\n\nForced apart by family pressures, it had been Lise who ended things, but the past, it seemed, was not easily left behind.\n\nKristopher had diligently pursued the leadership of the Norris family, harboring dreams of finally being with Lise.\n\nYet, when he reached his goal, he discovered that Lise had already chosen another.\n\nIn defiance of his family's expectations and perhaps out of bitterness, Kristopher turned to Carrie, a woman equally devoid of wealth or status, to become Mrs. Norris, thereby blocking any matchmaking attempts by his relatives.\n\nAt that time, Carrie faced immense pressure from her father, Tristan Campbell, who was pushing her towards a marriage with a playboy, the son of a business associate, to cover her grandmother's steep medical expenses.\n\nBoth Kristopher and Carrie, driven by their personal motives, consented to a marriage of convenience.\n\nOriginally set for just one year, their contractual marriage stretched beyond its term, sustained by a shared understanding between them.\n\nOver time, Carrie began to believe in the authenticity of their union, never suspecting that it was merely an extension of her hopes.\n\nJust moments ago, a fire had nearly claimed Carrie's life. In that critical moment, she reached out to Kristopher, only to be twice rebuffed as he spent his time with Lise.\n\nThis harsh reality shattered Carrie's illusions, revealing that her perceived transition from pretense to genuine relationship was nothing but a facade maintained by her own desires.\n\nCarrie wasn't even a temporary substitute in Kristopher's life but merely a pawn used to spite his family.\n\nAfter a poignant pause, tears welled up in Carrie's eyes, unstoppable and poignant.\n\nIt might be time for her to release herself from the shackles of her own hopeful delusions--to stop deceiving herself.\n\nChapter 2 Trending Topics\nThe overwhelming number of injuries from the fire was staggering, straining the already frantic doctors and nurses as they tried to provide aid.\n\nCarrie had been merely grazed by a splintered clothes rack, which left a deep, jagged wound on her calf. In comparison to the chaos around her, her wounds seemed almost negligible.\n\nShe managed to get basic care--a brisk cleaning and a quick wrap of bandages--at a local hospital before catching a cab back to her house.\n\nBayview Villa, a grand property under Kristopher's name, was technically their matrimonial residence.\n\nLiving alone had become the norm for Carrie, as Kristopher was hardly ever around. She had bid farewell to the housekeeper, discovering that her life could be quite adequately maintained with just takeout, deliveries, and the occasional visit from a part-time cleaner.\n\nNow, she found herself the sole occupant of the sprawling living room, sinking into the sofa, her gaze drifting across the empty space.\n\nThe stark, monochrome decor did nothing to imbue warmth into the atmosphere.\n\nA chilling realization crept up on her: this vast, elegant space felt more like a colossal tomb, a silent grave for her lost years of youth and a love that had quietly slipped away.\n\nIn this cold, echoing house, would anyone even notice if her breath ceased one day?\n\nCarrie exhaled a weary sigh, her frame heavy as she leaned against the cold wall for support, struggling up the stairs to her bedroom on the second floor.\n\nEach step was a battle, sending stabbing pains shooting through her from the surface of her skin down to her aching bones.\n\nThe house, stark and hollow, echoed even the smallest sounds, magnifying her sense of isolation.\n\nIt was today, amidst this profound silence, that Carrie truly grasped the all-encompassing nature of her loneliness--it was almost tangible, enveloping her senses with its texture and mournful whispers, tightening around her heart like a vice, producing a dull, relentless ache.\n\nUpon reaching the sanctuary of her bedroom, she collapsed onto the bed, the very embodiment of exhaustion, feeling it both physically and spiritually.\n\nJust as she surrendered to this weariness, the sharp ring of the phone pierced the silence.\n\n\"You reached out to me earlier. What do you need?\" Kristopher's voice cut through the line, cold and distant as ever.\n\nCarrie was caught off guard by his unexpected call. Words failed her as she parted her lips to respond, but before she could collect her thoughts, a soft, feminine voice floated through from the other end. \"Kristopher, will you join me to...\"\n\nA surge of emotions tightened Carrie's grip on the phone, her heart thumping louder with each second. Overwhelmed and unable to contain her rising panic, she demanded, \"Who's there with you?\"\n\nKristopher gave no answer, merely stating in a flat, disinterested voice, \"If there's something you need, let's catch up when I'm back. I have pressing engagements right now, so I must disconnect.\"\n\nHe promptly ended the call, cutting off any chance for Carrie to reply.\n\nAs the harsh beep of the disconnected line filled her ears, Carrie's lips twisted into a rueful grin. How utterly foolish she felt! Deep down, she knew his response all too well, yet she had clung to the hope of hearing his voice confirm it.\n\nWith a sense of self-inflicted irony, Carrie activated her tablet and scrolled through the day's hot topics.\n\nOne headline caught her eye: \"A female star shielded from harassment at a dinner by her formidable partner.\" A wry smile twisted her lips.\n\nCarrie knew all too well what it was like to face harassment at those kinds of dinners.\n\nShe vividly remembered her first major audition after her entering the showbiz; her agent had escorted her to a dinner with the influential director and producer of the drama series \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nAs a novice in the dizzying world of showbiz, Carrie had felt incredibly vulnerable, uncertain of how to navigate the murky waters of such gatherings.\n\nThe producer had eyed her shamelessly, sneering as he asked, \"Is this the new talent you're introducing? She appears presentable, but I'm curious to see how she fares with a drink. Here's the deal, if you can gulp down this bottle in one go, I'll secure you an audition for the lead role.\"\n\nCarrie was inclined to decline, but under the relentless pressure from her agent, she found herself compelled to consume the entire bottle.\n\nAs the evening wore on, she was hurriedly taken to the hospital suffering from a severe stomach ailment.\n\nHer agent, fretful about the prospect of the role slipping away to another, quickly settled the hospital charges and departed.\n\nAt that time, Carrie found herself isolated in a hospital bed for several long days.\n\nYet, even before Carrie could be released from the hospital, the media was abuzz with the announcement that Lise had secured the lead role in \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nSubsequently, her agent rebuked Carrie for her lack of ambition, complaining, \"You are more appealing than Lise, so why can't you show more drive? She cozied up to Mr. Norris and hardly had to make an effort. She's surrounded by people eager to cater to her every need. I've heard that Mr. Norris personally orchestrated her landing the lead role in this production!\"\n\nWhen the show premiered, Lise was catapulted into stardom, swiftly ascending to the elite echelons of the acting world.\n\nFrom that moment forward, Carrie let her acting aspirations wane and chose instead to devote herself entirely to supporting her husband, Kristopher.\n\nAfter all, no matter her efforts, she could never get the same career opportunities that Lise seemed to receive effortlessly with Kristopher's offhand remarks.\n\nAt that time, Carrie had believed she was filling the role that was meant to be Lise's as Mrs. Norris, which meant she owed Lise.\n\nBy giving up the career opportunities to Lise, Carrie thought they would settle their unspoken debt.\n\nHowever, Carrie hadn't foreseen that Lise would claim both the coveted career and Kristopher's affections.\n\nAs Lise's professional and love life blossomed, Carrie came to the painful realization that she had been overly consumed with her romantic pursuits, at the expense of her career, and now, she found herself bereft of both love and professional fulfillment.\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Carrie viewed her past two years as tragically misguided.\n\nGiven another opportunity, she resolved she wouldn't be so unguarded, letting her heart recklessly fall captive to Kristopher's charm.\n\n\"Ms. Spencer, the new copyright contract is prepared. Please review it for any discrepancies.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed with the alert, snapping Carrie out of her reverie. She gazed at the PDF file attached in the message, her mind briefly overwhelmed.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Katrina Spencer, Carrie had once made a name for herself as a budding screenwriter, selling numerous scripts in her early days.\n\nDuring her early career as Katrina, Carrie often sold her work for a pittance, compelled by her urgent need for immediate cash.\n\nOver the years, these scripts transformed into blockbuster films and hit series, catapulting Katrina's reputation to new heights.\n\nBy this time, Carrie had married Kristopher and was no longer plagued by the financial woes that had once driven her to desperation--her grandmother's hefty medical bills were a thing of the past. With her financial crises resolved, Carrie's life had pivoted to domestic responsibilities, striving to be an exemplary wife to Kristopher. Amidst these changes, her pseudonym, Katrina Spencer, gradually receded into the background.\n\nHowever, her past as Katrina wasn't ready to be shelved just yet. Recently, an interested buyer had come forward, ready to pay a handsome sum for one of her old scripts.\n\nCarrie, however, was hesitant to sell. She raised several concerns about the contract presented to her, and to her astonishment, the buyer was genuine enough to revise it accordingly.\n\nHolding the revised contract in her hands, Carrie inhaled deeply, her resolve hardening. She seemed to have reached a crucial decision.\n\nHer fingers danced over her phone's keyboard with swift precision, typing out a firm command. \"Create a divorce agreement following my terms and ensure it reaches Kristopher Norris at the Norris Group.\"\n\nWithout pausing for a response, she placed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step echoing a blend of determination and newfound independence.\n\nChapter 3 Exchange Of Conveniences\nThirty minutes had passed, Carrie finally heaved herself up from the bathtub, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. As she lifted her gaze, her own image in the mirror halted her movements--her skin appeared as smooth and impeccable as fine porcelain, glowing with an unblemished radiance.\n\nHer eyes, deep pools of allure, sparkled with an enchanting, soft warmth, inviting anyone who dared meet her gaze.\n\nDespite edging into her late twenties at twenty-five, she reveled in the fact that time had yet to etch its marks upon her flawless complexion.\n\nSurely, a woman with such a visage had no place for self-pity.\n\nAbsorbed in her contemplation, Carrie carelessly extended her right leg onto the cold floor, forgetting it was the very limb she had injured. Wrapped excessively in cling film to shield it from moisture, the tight encasement had stifled her circulation, rendering her leg eerily numb. As her foot touched down, it betrayed her, slipping forward unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Carrie gasped, her arms flailing in a frantic ballet, searching for a lifeline in the void.\n\nJust as she teetered on the brink of a painful rendezvous with the floor, the bathroom door burst open.\n\nKristopher stood at the entrance, his suit immaculately tailored, creating a striking figure. As their eyes locked, he paused, visibly taken aback, then quickly closed the distance with brisk strides.\n\nCarrie's breath caught as Kristopher swept her up in a graceful bridal style, an unexpected tightness wrapping around her waist. Caught off guard by his sudden appearance, Carrie realized with a jolt that she was completely bare. A flush of embarrassment washed over her as she instinctively clutched her hands over her chest.\n\nThis was their first moment of such intimacy since their wedding, and the discomfort made her toes curl inward, her skin blushing a delicate shade of pink.\n\nKristopher looked down at her with a mischievous grin. \"Let's be honest, there's not much to see,\" he teased gently.\n\nFeeling both mortified and slightly irritated, Carrie snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Norris, after all you've seen, I suppose nothing can impress you anymore.\"\n\nShe carried her C-cup curves with understated charm, a touch of sensuality that outshone Lise's painfully flat, almost awkwardly rigid build.\n\nYet Carrie knew well that without love, even the most perfect physique paled in comparison to the charm of one dearly cherished.\n\nNonchalantly, Kristopher reached for a bathrobe hanging behind the door and draped it over her. His frown deepened at her comment. \"What are you talking about, Carrie?\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike him, and his expression grew even more impatient. \"Tell me, did you send those divorce papers in the dead of night just to lure me back here--to catch you completely bare?\" His tone was a mix of disbelief and annoyance. \"I told you I was swamped with work. Was this dramatic display really necessary?\"\n\nCarrie's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the tension between them. He was always so quick to lose patience with her.\n\nShe wasn't the type to throw around words like divorce or breakups lightly. In fact, this was the first time she'd ever mentioned divorce in their two-year marriage, yet he seemed indifferent to her turmoil. He simply dismissed her concerns as if she were overreacting about trivial matters.\n\nDespite the throbbing pain in her leg, Carrie mustered her strength and said, \"Put me down.\"\n\nKristopher, however, paid no heed, his eyes scanning her leg swathed in bandages. His brow furrowed slightly. \"What happened to your leg? Is this some elaborate ploy to lure me back?\"\n\nAt his words, a bitter laugh escaped Carrie.\n\nIt seemed he viewed her as merely seeking attention, and in failing to capture it, she had likely concocted a story to draw him back, allowing her to dramatize her plight in his presence.\n\nWith a blank face, she replied untruthfully, \"It's a beauty treatment that shouldn't get wet.\"\n\n\"Why did you suddenly decide to undergo such a treatment?\" Kristopher inquired, his tone casual as he carried her outside, not pressing the issue further.\n\nHis frame was large, and through his thin shirt, she could distinctly feel the warmth of his body and the defined shape of his chest muscles.\n\nThe closeness created an uncomfortable tension for Carrie, who had resolved to end things once and for all.\n\nHer voice climbed involuntarily, sharper this time. \"Oh, since when have you been concerned with such minor things, Mr. Norris?\"\n\nFor the first time, Kristopher witnessed her using biting sarcasm; it struck him as peculiarly amusing. With a calm demeanor, he responded, \"You're my wife, it's only natural I'd be concerned about your well-being.\"\n\n\"Really?\" There was a somber note in Carrie's voice now. \"It seems like you've never really regarded me as your wife. I'm scared that if I were to die, you wouldn't even know until much later.\"\n\nAfter all, at that very moment, Kristopher had been distracted, lost in moments with his first love, too consumed to lend an ear to her desperate pleas.\n\nCaught off guard by her accusation, Kristopher's eyes widened with surprise before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. \"Carrie, what's brought on this sudden outburst of anger? Just because I was tied up this afternoon and missed your call? Perhaps I've been too indulgent with you lately, and it's made you a bit too presumptuous?\"\n\nCarrie froze, startled. Was he accusing her of being too presumptuous?\n\nShe realized their marriage had always been lopsided. In his eyes, she was nothing more than a transactional partner, a woman who had bartered her freedom for financial security.\n\nTheir union was meant to be a mere exchange of conveniences, yet she had, quite foolishly, fallen deeply in love with him.\n\nIn the tricky terrain of romance, the one who fell first invariably found themselves at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nKristopher's dismissive reaction left Carrie reeling, her emotions dismissed as trifles, a tight knot of suffocation rising in her chest.\n\n\"I said to put me down this instant!\" Carrie exclaimed, jerking her head to the side, her voice laced with a sharp edge of impatience.\n\nKristopher remained mute, effortlessly carrying her towards the bed before suddenly releasing his hold.\n\nCarrie felt a jolt as the support vanished, her heart skipping a beat as she instinctively grasped for him.\n\nTheir bodies collided on the bed, her bathrobe teetering on the brink of decency, threatening to unravel with any minor shift.\n\nPropped on one elbow, Kristopher gazed down at her, his lips curled into a sly, teasing grin. \"You wanted to be let go, didn't you? So why cling to me now?\"\n\nHis eyes, deep and sparkling like a midnight lake speckled with stars, captivated her.\n\nIn those celestial depths, Carrie caught a glimpse of her own reflection.\n\nAt times like this, she was misled into believing he harbored a deep affection.\n\nSadly, his heart was a fortress reserved for Lise, and all Carrie had left were empty fantasies.\n\n\"Boring!\" she exclaimed, her voice devoid of any enthusiasm as she attempted to rise, her hand inadvertently brushing against something unexpected.\n\nThe following moment brought a noticeable shift in his cock pressing against her stomach.\n\n\"Don't move, or I can't promise what might happen next,\" he warned in a deep, gravelly voice.\n\nWith a frown, Carrie internally cursed upon hearing the statement.\n\nIt was an undeniable fact. Primal instincts steered the actions of men. Absence of affection didn't quell their basic desires.\n\nYet, she dared not agitate Kristopher. Angling her face away, her body remained rigid, frozen in place.\n\nCarrie, feeling irked, shot back. \"Didn't you say there's nothing here to see? What's with the reaction now, Mr. Norris? Are you really that easy to impress?\"\n\nNo sooner had her words flown than she grasped the potential repercussions of her sharp tongue.\n\nA wave of regret surged through Carrie, but instead of anger, Kristopher responded with a chuckle, \"You are my wife, after all. Since that's something I can't alter, I might as well embrace it. Besides, it's been years since we became husband and wife--it would be a shame to neglect you completely.\"\n\nChapter 4 Are You Out Of Your Mind?\nKristopher slipped his hand beneath the folds of her bathrobe, his touch tracing the curve of Carrie's skin, as smooth and delicate as silk. He encircled her slender waist, drawing her closer with a gentle yet firm grip.\n\nHer face, a captivating canvas of defiance and visible irritation, ignited in him an uncontrollable urge to claim victory over her resistance.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy, yet he remained composed, slowly removing his tailored suit.\n\nThe fabric of his suit brushed lightly against Carrie's cheek, releasing a mix of scents: a familiar woody aroma intertwined with an unexpected zesty twist of lemon. It was unmistakably Jo Malone's Blue Agava and Cacao--Lise's signature scent.\n\nA surge of nausea overwhelmed Carrie at the realization.\n\nAs Kristopher's eyes, now shaded with a stormy intensity, drew nearer to hers, the proximity conjured unwelcome visions of him with Lise. Her stomach churned violently, and with a sudden movement, she pushed him away, propping herself up with a jolt and a dry retch.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer stomach had been empty all day, leaving her with nothing to bring up.\n\nThe desire in Kristopher's gaze flickered out, replaced by a cold, detached expression as he withdrew slightly.\n\nObserving the genuine distress and the reddening of Carrie's eyes, Kristopher perceived her reaction for outright disgust at their closeness.\n\nHe paused, fingers adjusting his shirt cuffs, his voice cold as he confronted her. \"Carrie, is this reaction reserved only for me, or is it how you respond to all men?\"\n\nThe air in the room turned frosty, thick with tension.\n\nCarrie swallowed the sharp sting in her throat, her eyes widening in shock as she stared up at him.\n\nEver since their marriage, she had cut ties with nearly all her male friends, yet here was Kristopher, casually tossing out comments sharp enough to cut glass.\n\nThe years of love she had poured into their relationship now seemed utterly futile.\n\nHeat crept up her neck, coloring her cheeks a bright scarlet as indignation took hold. Without thinking, her hand flew up and delivered a stinging slap across Kristopher's face.\n\nAll her suppressed grievances from the day ignited in that swift motion.\n\nHer bathrobe, loosened in the heat of the moment, slipped from her shoulders. Ignoring the flush of exposure, she swiftly gathered the fabric and draped it around herself, her movements quick and firm.\n\nThe impact of her slap had left a light, crimson mark on Kristopher's cheek, marking him with her outrage.\n\nHis eyes, wide with disbelief, met hers. \"Carrie, are you out of your mind?\"\n\nOut of her mind? Yes, she was clearly insane to ever fall for him in the first place.\n\nCarrie fumed silently, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nSuddenly, the sharp buzz of the phone on the table cut through the mounting tension, its vibration bringing a brief respite from their standoff.\n\nKristopher cast a fleeting glance at the message, shut off the phone with a snap, and strode towards the door, his back rigid with tension.\n\nHer voice, firm and unwavering, chased after him. \"We're getting a divorce! Make sure you sign those papers before you walk out that door!\"\n\nKristopher paused briefly and said sharply, \"I have something to do now. When I return, do whatever pleases you.\" With that, he forcefully shut the door.\n\nCarrie's eyes followed his unwavering exit, feeling an oppressive weight compressing her chest once again.\n\nShe disregarded the sharp sting in her leg and hobbled determinedly toward her tablet. Fingers trembling, she hastily navigated to Lise's Twitter page.\n\nLise had just uploaded a new tweet.\n\nThe photo showed her lying down with a fever patch adhered to her forehead, still enveloped in Kristopher's familiar jacket.\n\nThe caption read, \"Being sick makes me extra clingy. Wishing I had someone here. Stay cozy and take care, everyone!\"\n\nThe simultaneous timing of these two events made it almost impossible for Carrie not to suspect that Kristopher had dashed off to tend to Lise.\n\nCarrie's instincts loudly proclaimed that this was no accident; Lise had deliberately sought to tug at Kristopher's heartstrings. It appeared her tactics were effective.\n\nNot even Carrie's stark threat of divorce could overshadow Lise's theatrical display of vulnerability.\n\nSeething with fury, Carrie quaked like a leaf swept into a storm.\n\nShe steeled herself against the heartache, forcefully ripping the plastic wrap from her aching leg.\n\nAfter her lengthy soak, the bath's lingering moisture had infiltrated her skin, inflaming the wound until it was a vivid, angry red and painfully swollen.\n\nShe, too, could be clingy. Even in the harshest times back in the county, she had shown vulnerability, breaking down into soft sobs within the comforting arms of her grandmother, especially that one time she got burned by the scalding kettle.\n\nBut such vulnerability had its time and place, and it wasn't now.\n\nThe stark reality of Kristopher's exit forced Carrie to confront her need for self-reliance.\n\nBiting down hard on her lip, Carrie cleaned the throbbing wound with a practiced hand before securely wrapping it anew.\n\nShe rose with a newfound resolve and yanked a black suitcase from the far end of her expansive walk-in closet--it held all the belongings she'd brought into this house as a hopeful bride.\n\nShe grabbed a fresh set of clothes to slip into and left a bank card neatly on the bedside table.\n\nShe had transferred every penny she'd earned over the past year onto that card, effectively settling her financial entanglements with Kristopher over the last two years and cutting him out of her life for good.\n\nDragging the heavy suitcase behind her, she limped painfully out of the opulent villa.\n\nAs she passed through the gate, she wrapped her baseball jacket more tightly around her slight figure, her silhouette hauntingly solitary in the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe night air of early spring was bitingly cold, devoid of any trace of warmth, a chill that seemed almost faint compared to the ice forming in Carrie's shattered heart.\n\nShe had arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a heart full of dreams, and now she was leaving, dreams crumbled, utterly alone.\n\nA bitter laugh slipped through her lips. If only she hadn't fallen so hard for him, if only she'd proposed an amicable separation at the end of their agreed year, maybe she wouldn't be wandering now, a lost soul in the shadow of her former self.\n\nLise didn't have to lift a finger, and Carrie had already fallen, utterly broken and beyond redemption.\n\nChapter 5 A Gathering\nMeanwhile, in the Oasis Club, renowned as the priciest spot in Orkset, the air within the VIP room crackled with excitement. Under the spell of bright lights and thumping music, a diverse group of men and women lounged together, basking in the exclusivity of the setting.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, revealing Kristopher in the doorway.\n\nThe karaoke session halted abruptly as the crowd turned to greet him in unison, voices mingling. \"Kristopher...\"\n\nBefore they could utter another word, a woman cloaked from head to toe stepped out from behind him.\n\nLise, with a fluid motion, removed her mask and slid her arm through Kristopher's. She addressed the room with a poised charm. \"My assistant took a sudden leave, and I found myself without company. Not keen on spending the evening alone, I invited Kristopher to join me. I trust that's alright?\"\n\nLise's beauty was without question. Her face was a delicate composition of cherry lips and a sculpted nose, framed by eyes that shimmered with a vulnerable allure, commanding a protective fervor from those around her--her presence, ethereal.\n\nIn contrast, Carrie's features were more pronounced, her beauty vivid and striking. Lise, by comparison, carried a softer, more understated elegance.\n\nYet, as it often goes, matters of the heart followed no simple paths.\n\nWhile Kristopher and Carrie were married, it was in name only; Kristopher seemed detached and seldom included her in private social events.\n\nThe group didn't have much of a relationship with Carrie, leading them to feel no obligation to defend her.\n\nUpon hearing Lise's comment, a moment of discomfort rippled through the air. Nonetheless, they quickly recovered, offering a congenial smile as they said, \"We're all friends here; let's not bother with formalities.\"\n\nLise offered a subtle, knowing smile, as she gracefully accompanied Kristopher into the bustling room.\n\nThe event that evening had been meticulously planned to express appreciation for Kristopher's contributions.\n\nAs they stepped into the room, the crowd parted like the sea, making way for them to proceed to the seats of honor.\n\nThe group's leader handed Kristopher a glass of wine with a flourish, proclaiming with a broad grin, \"We truly owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Norris! Your exceptional talents are the talk of the town, and witnessing them firsthand today only confirms it. Without your expertise, securing this contract would have been a fantasy!\"\n\nTheir gathering marked the launch of a novel shopping platform, one that had been in negotiation with numerous local brands in Orkset. But the scenario changed dramatically when the tech giant JoyBuy dramatically entered the scene, stirring up the competitive landscape.\n\nCompeting with JoyBuy was akin to the classic David versus Goliath tale--hopelessly daunting. In a surge of desperation, they turned to Kristopher, reaching out through a network of connections for his renowned strategic prowess.\n\nWith his characteristic swiftness, Kristopher hatched an ingenious plan and swiftly secured the deal, snatching it from the clutches of JoyBuy right before the business association could ink their agreement--a masterful coup that reverberated success.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround only intensified the already deep respect everyone held for Kristopher.\n\nAlbin Murray, beaming with pride, couldn't help but boast, \"Ah, just look at the caliber of his friends! They thought they could steal deals right under our noses, obviously underestimating Kristopher's clout!\"\n\nAlbin, born into the wealthy Murray family, counted himself among Kristopher's closest friends. He was renowned for his sprawling social web--a network through which the desperate plea for help was channeled to Kristopher.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristopher himself, the focus of all their discussions, reclined nonchalantly on the couch, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe was well-versed in the art of receiving compliments; thus, his expression stayed calm and detached.\n\nThe ambient light sculpted his angular features, casting dramatic shadows that emphasized his high nose bridge and sharply cut jawline, as though he were a living masterpiece.\n\nHis natural grace and detachment eclipsed any terrestrial magnificence.\n\nFollowing a sequence of celebratory toasts, when it became apparent that Kristopher merely touched his glass without truly drinking, the rest of the company toned down their conversation, allowing him a moment of repose with his eyes gently shut.\n\nLise, slightly feverish, opted not to indulge in the spirits, choosing instead to sit in serene silence next to Kristopher, her eyes lingering on him with a look of deep, unmistakable adoration.\n\nAlbin, captivated by the seemingly perfect pair, pondered the whims of destiny. He discreetly captured their image with his smartphone and nonchalantly shared it across his social networks.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the liquor dwindled, the room's door swung open anew.\n\nKristopher's personal assistant, Oliver Brooks, made his entrance, acknowledging the gathering with a courteous nod that bordered on respect but avoided groveling, swiftly positioning himself in front of Kristopher.\n\nSilence hung in the air, yet Lise, unable to contain her curiosity, leaned in and whispered, \"What's going on?\"\n\nOliver, maintaining his focus on Kristopher, chose not to respond directly to her.\n\nA flush of embarrassment tinted Lise's cheeks as she turned towards Kristopher, hesitatingly inquiring, \"Should I leave?\"\n\nKristopher adjusted his posture, his voice low and calm as he instructed, \"Go ahead, speak.\"\n\nA shiver of apprehension coursed through Oliver as he tentatively began, \"Mr. Norris, Mrs. Norris has departed from Bayview Villa, and...\"\n\n&9&\n0:00 / 4:50",

        "primary_text": "\"He finally remembered the woman waiting for him at home, only to face her divorce papers. Confident she'd regret it, he signed. But post-divorce, she blossomed, turning heads everywhere. Defeated, he begged to win her back!\n=====\nIn the bustling, weathered heart of Orkset, flames erupted violently within an ancient apartment building. Propelled by gusts of wind, the fire devoured the structure, belching dense smoke and bright, searing tongues of flame.\n\n\"Saved! They've been saved.\" The words echoed amidst the chaos.\n\nFirefighters emerged from the smoldering inferno, carrying Carrie Campbell to safety at the roadside.\n\nHer features, usually refined and expressive, were now smeared with soot; her sparkling eyes dimmed to a vacant gaze, hollow and lost.\n\nAs reality seeped back into her consciousness, Carrie felt a rush of gratitude overpower her usual composure. Her voice, hoarse and weak, conveyed a profound \"thank you\" to her rescuers. Shaking, she fumbled for her phone, her fingertips quivering as they found the familiar number.\n\n\"Hello, the person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe automated message played after a few rings, leaving her with a lump in her throat, her unvoiced frustrations and sorrow welling up inside her.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a deafening roar, the explosion abruptly silenced the cold, mechanical voice echoing through the line. Carrie's head snapped upwards, shock painted on her face as she witnessed the apartment she had just exited erupt into flames.\n\nChunks of debris were hurled into the air by the force of the blast, scattering across the sky.\n\nPanic engulfed the crowd as survivors, freshly rescued, screamed in terror. They huddled together, seeking solace in each other's arms, their cries piercing the tumultuous scene. In stark contrast, Carrie lay alone on a stretcher, her isolation magnified amidst the chaos.\n\n\"Kristopher...\" Fighting the dread creeping up her spine, Carrie pressed her lips together tightly and dialed her husband's number again, her resolve unwavering.\n\nYet, the call disconnected after a few short rings, leaving her with a haunting silence.\n\nJust then, a Twitter notification flickered on her phone screen.\n\nThe gossip feed was alive with the latest gossip: #LiseNash #MysteriouBoyfriend.\n\nAccording to the tweet, a producer from a well-known variety show had invited the renowned star Lise Nash to a dinner, which had quickly soured when she declined to partake in a toast.\n\nThis act of defiance had sparked a confrontation, only to be interrupted by Lise's domineering boyfriend. He stormed into the private dining room, dismissing the producer with a dismissive wave and escorting Lise away.\n\nThe tweet described the scene vividly, painting a picture of a powerful man defending his beloved partner.\n\nYet, perhaps due to his prominence, only the back of the man was visible in the accompanying photos, preserving his anonymity. Meanwhile, Lise, donning an oversized suit jacket, beamed a smile, reaching out to clasp his hand as they departed together.\n\nCarrie's eyes were glued to the screen, her stare intense and unblinking as she absorbed the image before her.\n\nThere he was--Kristopher Norris!\n\nThe suit jacket draped carelessly over Lise was a dead giveaway.\n\nEvery piece of clothing Kristopher owned had been meticulously tailored by a master craftsman abroad, a detail Carrie knew all too well.\n\nHer grip on her phone tightened, her knuckles blanching to a stark white, as if her very soul were being squeezed by an invisible hand, the pain sharp and acid-like in its intensity.\n\nIn her most desperate moment, Kristopher had coldly disconnected their call, choosing instead to be at Lise's side.\n\nWhat was the worth of their two-year marriage?\n\nThe tears she had been holding back now overwhelmed her, streaming down her face.\n\nEven as she tilted her head back in a futile attempt to stem the flow, the tears continued to escape.\n\nLise had always been Kristopher's first love, a fact whispered and gossiped about among their circles. The Norris family had never approved of Lise, seeing her ordinary background as unfitting.\n\nForced apart by family pressures, it had been Lise who ended things, but the past, it seemed, was not easily left behind.\n\nKristopher had diligently pursued the leadership of the Norris family, harboring dreams of finally being with Lise.\n\nYet, when he reached his goal, he discovered that Lise had already chosen another.\n\nIn defiance of his family's expectations and perhaps out of bitterness, Kristopher turned to Carrie, a woman equally devoid of wealth or status, to become Mrs. Norris, thereby blocking any matchmaking attempts by his relatives.\n\nAt that time, Carrie faced immense pressure from her father, Tristan Campbell, who was pushing her towards a marriage with a playboy, the son of a business associate, to cover her grandmother's steep medical expenses.\n\nBoth Kristopher and Carrie, driven by their personal motives, consented to a marriage of convenience.\n\nOriginally set for just one year, their contractual marriage stretched beyond its term, sustained by a shared understanding between them.\n\nOver time, Carrie began to believe in the authenticity of their union, never suspecting that it was merely an extension of her hopes.\n\nJust moments ago, a fire had nearly claimed Carrie's life. In that critical moment, she reached out to Kristopher, only to be twice rebuffed as he spent his time with Lise.\n\nThis harsh reality shattered Carrie's illusions, revealing that her perceived transition from pretense to genuine relationship was nothing but a facade maintained by her own desires.\n\nCarrie wasn't even a temporary substitute in Kristopher's life but merely a pawn used to spite his family.\n\nAfter a poignant pause, tears welled up in Carrie's eyes, unstoppable and poignant.\n\nIt might be time for her to release herself from the shackles of her own hopeful delusions--to stop deceiving herself.\n\nChapter 2 Trending Topics\nThe overwhelming number of injuries from the fire was staggering, straining the already frantic doctors and nurses as they tried to provide aid.\n\nCarrie had been merely grazed by a splintered clothes rack, which left a deep, jagged wound on her calf. In comparison to the chaos around her, her wounds seemed almost negligible.\n\nShe managed to get basic care--a brisk cleaning and a quick wrap of bandages--at a local hospital before catching a cab back to her house.\n\nBayview Villa, a grand property under Kristopher's name, was technically their matrimonial residence.\n\nLiving alone had become the norm for Carrie, as Kristopher was hardly ever around. She had bid farewell to the housekeeper, discovering that her life could be quite adequately maintained with just takeout, deliveries, and the occasional visit from a part-time cleaner.\n\nNow, she found herself the sole occupant of the sprawling living room, sinking into the sofa, her gaze drifting across the empty space.\n\nThe stark, monochrome decor did nothing to imbue warmth into the atmosphere.\n\nA chilling realization crept up on her: this vast, elegant space felt more like a colossal tomb, a silent grave for her lost years of youth and a love that had quietly slipped away.\n\nIn this cold, echoing house, would anyone even notice if her breath ceased one day?\n\nCarrie exhaled a weary sigh, her frame heavy as she leaned against the cold wall for support, struggling up the stairs to her bedroom on the second floor.\n\nEach step was a battle, sending stabbing pains shooting through her from the surface of her skin down to her aching bones.\n\nThe house, stark and hollow, echoed even the smallest sounds, magnifying her sense of isolation.\n\nIt was today, amidst this profound silence, that Carrie truly grasped the all-encompassing nature of her loneliness--it was almost tangible, enveloping her senses with its texture and mournful whispers, tightening around her heart like a vice, producing a dull, relentless ache.\n\nUpon reaching the sanctuary of her bedroom, she collapsed onto the bed, the very embodiment of exhaustion, feeling it both physically and spiritually.\n\nJust as she surrendered to this weariness, the sharp ring of the phone pierced the silence.\n\n\"You reached out to me earlier. What do you need?\" Kristopher's voice cut through the line, cold and distant as ever.\n\nCarrie was caught off guard by his unexpected call. Words failed her as she parted her lips to respond, but before she could collect her thoughts, a soft, feminine voice floated through from the other end. \"Kristopher, will you join me to...\"\n\nA surge of emotions tightened Carrie's grip on the phone, her heart thumping louder with each second. Overwhelmed and unable to contain her rising panic, she demanded, \"Who's there with you?\"\n\nKristopher gave no answer, merely stating in a flat, disinterested voice, \"If there's something you need, let's catch up when I'm back. I have pressing engagements right now, so I must disconnect.\"\n\nHe promptly ended the call, cutting off any chance for Carrie to reply.\n\nAs the harsh beep of the disconnected line filled her ears, Carrie's lips twisted into a rueful grin. How utterly foolish she felt! Deep down, she knew his response all too well, yet she had clung to the hope of hearing his voice confirm it.\n\nWith a sense of self-inflicted irony, Carrie activated her tablet and scrolled through the day's hot topics.\n\nOne headline caught her eye: \"A female star shielded from harassment at a dinner by her formidable partner.\" A wry smile twisted her lips.\n\nCarrie knew all too well what it was like to face harassment at those kinds of dinners.\n\nShe vividly remembered her first major audition after her entering the showbiz; her agent had escorted her to a dinner with the influential director and producer of the drama series \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nAs a novice in the dizzying world of showbiz, Carrie had felt incredibly vulnerable, uncertain of how to navigate the murky waters of such gatherings.\n\nThe producer had eyed her shamelessly, sneering as he asked, \"Is this the new talent you're introducing? She appears presentable, but I'm curious to see how she fares with a drink. Here's the deal, if you can gulp down this bottle in one go, I'll secure you an audition for the lead role.\"\n\nCarrie was inclined to decline, but under the relentless pressure from her agent, she found herself compelled to consume the entire bottle.\n\nAs the evening wore on, she was hurriedly taken to the hospital suffering from a severe stomach ailment.\n\nHer agent, fretful about the prospect of the role slipping away to another, quickly settled the hospital charges and departed.\n\nAt that time, Carrie found herself isolated in a hospital bed for several long days.\n\nYet, even before Carrie could be released from the hospital, the media was abuzz with the announcement that Lise had secured the lead role in \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nSubsequently, her agent rebuked Carrie for her lack of ambition, complaining, \"You are more appealing than Lise, so why can't you show more drive? She cozied up to Mr. Norris and hardly had to make an effort. She's surrounded by people eager to cater to her every need. I've heard that Mr. Norris personally orchestrated her landing the lead role in this production!\"\n\nWhen the show premiered, Lise was catapulted into stardom, swiftly ascending to the elite echelons of the acting world.\n\nFrom that moment forward, Carrie let her acting aspirations wane and chose instead to devote herself entirely to supporting her husband, Kristopher.\n\nAfter all, no matter her efforts, she could never get the same career opportunities that Lise seemed to receive effortlessly with Kristopher's offhand remarks.\n\nAt that time, Carrie had believed she was filling the role that was meant to be Lise's as Mrs. Norris, which meant she owed Lise.\n\nBy giving up the career opportunities to Lise, Carrie thought they would settle their unspoken debt.\n\nHowever, Carrie hadn't foreseen that Lise would claim both the coveted career and Kristopher's affections.\n\nAs Lise's professional and love life blossomed, Carrie came to the painful realization that she had been overly consumed with her romantic pursuits, at the expense of her career, and now, she found herself bereft of both love and professional fulfillment.\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Carrie viewed her past two years as tragically misguided.\n\nGiven another opportunity, she resolved she wouldn't be so unguarded, letting her heart recklessly fall captive to Kristopher's charm.\n\n\"Ms. Spencer, the new copyright contract is prepared. Please review it for any discrepancies.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed with the alert, snapping Carrie out of her reverie. She gazed at the PDF file attached in the message, her mind briefly overwhelmed.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Katrina Spencer, Carrie had once made a name for herself as a budding screenwriter, selling numerous scripts in her early days.\n\nDuring her early career as Katrina, Carrie often sold her work for a pittance, compelled by her urgent need for immediate cash.\n\nOver the years, these scripts transformed into blockbuster films and hit series, catapulting Katrina's reputation to new heights.\n\nBy this time, Carrie had married Kristopher and was no longer plagued by the financial woes that had once driven her to desperation--her grandmother's hefty medical bills were a thing of the past. With her financial crises resolved, Carrie's life had pivoted to domestic responsibilities, striving to be an exemplary wife to Kristopher. Amidst these changes, her pseudonym, Katrina Spencer, gradually receded into the background.\n\nHowever, her past as Katrina wasn't ready to be shelved just yet. Recently, an interested buyer had come forward, ready to pay a handsome sum for one of her old scripts.\n\nCarrie, however, was hesitant to sell. She raised several concerns about the contract presented to her, and to her astonishment, the buyer was genuine enough to revise it accordingly.\n\nHolding the revised contract in her hands, Carrie inhaled deeply, her resolve hardening. She seemed to have reached a crucial decision.\n\nHer fingers danced over her phone's keyboard with swift precision, typing out a firm command. \"Create a divorce agreement following my terms and ensure it reaches Kristopher Norris at the Norris Group.\"\n\nWithout pausing for a response, she placed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step echoing a blend of determination and newfound independence.\n\nChapter 3 Exchange Of Conveniences\nThirty minutes had passed, Carrie finally heaved herself up from the bathtub, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. As she lifted her gaze, her own image in the mirror halted her movements--her skin appeared as smooth and impeccable as fine porcelain, glowing with an unblemished radiance.\n\nHer eyes, deep pools of allure, sparkled with an enchanting, soft warmth, inviting anyone who dared meet her gaze.\n\nDespite edging into her late twenties at twenty-five, she reveled in the fact that time had yet to etch its marks upon her flawless complexion.\n\nSurely, a woman with such a visage had no place for self-pity.\n\nAbsorbed in her contemplation, Carrie carelessly extended her right leg onto the cold floor, forgetting it was the very limb she had injured. Wrapped excessively in cling film to shield it from moisture, the tight encasement had stifled her circulation, rendering her leg eerily numb. As her foot touched down, it betrayed her, slipping forward unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Carrie gasped, her arms flailing in a frantic ballet, searching for a lifeline in the void.\n\nJust as she teetered on the brink of a painful rendezvous with the floor, the bathroom door burst open.\n\nKristopher stood at the entrance, his suit immaculately tailored, creating a striking figure. As their eyes locked, he paused, visibly taken aback, then quickly closed the distance with brisk strides.\n\nCarrie's breath caught as Kristopher swept her up in a graceful bridal style, an unexpected tightness wrapping around her waist. Caught off guard by his sudden appearance, Carrie realized with a jolt that she was completely bare. A flush of embarrassment washed over her as she instinctively clutched her hands over her chest.\n\nThis was their first moment of such intimacy since their wedding, and the discomfort made her toes curl inward, her skin blushing a delicate shade of pink.\n\nKristopher looked down at her with a mischievous grin. \"Let's be honest, there's not much to see,\" he teased gently.\n\nFeeling both mortified and slightly irritated, Carrie snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Norris, after all you've seen, I suppose nothing can impress you anymore.\"\n\nShe carried her C-cup curves with understated charm, a touch of sensuality that outshone Lise's painfully flat, almost awkwardly rigid build.\n\nYet Carrie knew well that without love, even the most perfect physique paled in comparison to the charm of one dearly cherished.\n\nNonchalantly, Kristopher reached for a bathrobe hanging behind the door and draped it over her. His frown deepened at her comment. \"What are you talking about, Carrie?\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike him, and his expression grew even more impatient. \"Tell me, did you send those divorce papers in the dead of night just to lure me back here--to catch you completely bare?\" His tone was a mix of disbelief and annoyance. \"I told you I was swamped with work. Was this dramatic display really necessary?\"\n\nCarrie's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the tension between them. He was always so quick to lose patience with her.\n\nShe wasn't the type to throw around words like divorce or breakups lightly. In fact, this was the first time she'd ever mentioned divorce in their two-year marriage, yet he seemed indifferent to her turmoil. He simply dismissed her concerns as if she were overreacting about trivial matters.\n\nDespite the throbbing pain in her leg, Carrie mustered her strength and said, \"Put me down.\"\n\nKristopher, however, paid no heed, his eyes scanning her leg swathed in bandages. His brow furrowed slightly. \"What happened to your leg? Is this some elaborate ploy to lure me back?\"\n\nAt his words, a bitter laugh escaped Carrie.\n\nIt seemed he viewed her as merely seeking attention, and in failing to capture it, she had likely concocted a story to draw him back, allowing her to dramatize her plight in his presence.\n\nWith a blank face, she replied untruthfully, \"It's a beauty treatment that shouldn't get wet.\"\n\n\"Why did you suddenly decide to undergo such a treatment?\" Kristopher inquired, his tone casual as he carried her outside, not pressing the issue further.\n\nHis frame was large, and through his thin shirt, she could distinctly feel the warmth of his body and the defined shape of his chest muscles.\n\nThe closeness created an uncomfortable tension for Carrie, who had resolved to end things once and for all.\n\nHer voice climbed involuntarily, sharper this time. \"Oh, since when have you been concerned with such minor things, Mr. Norris?\"\n\nFor the first time, Kristopher witnessed her using biting sarcasm; it struck him as peculiarly amusing. With a calm demeanor, he responded, \"You're my wife, it's only natural I'd be concerned about your well-being.\"\n\n\"Really?\" There was a somber note in Carrie's voice now. \"It seems like you've never really regarded me as your wife. I'm scared that if I were to die, you wouldn't even know until much later.\"\n\nAfter all, at that very moment, Kristopher had been distracted, lost in moments with his first love, too consumed to lend an ear to her desperate pleas.\n\nCaught off guard by her accusation, Kristopher's eyes widened with surprise before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. \"Carrie, what's brought on this sudden outburst of anger? Just because I was tied up this afternoon and missed your call? Perhaps I've been too indulgent with you lately, and it's made you a bit too presumptuous?\"\n\nCarrie froze, startled. Was he accusing her of being too presumptuous?\n\nShe realized their marriage had always been lopsided. In his eyes, she was nothing more than a transactional partner, a woman who had bartered her freedom for financial security.\n\nTheir union was meant to be a mere exchange of conveniences, yet she had, quite foolishly, fallen deeply in love with him.\n\nIn the tricky terrain of romance, the one who fell first invariably found themselves at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nKristopher's dismissive reaction left Carrie reeling, her emotions dismissed as trifles, a tight knot of suffocation rising in her chest.\n\n\"I said to put me down this instant!\" Carrie exclaimed, jerking her head to the side, her voice laced with a sharp edge of impatience.\n\nKristopher remained mute, effortlessly carrying her towards the bed before suddenly releasing his hold.\n\nCarrie felt a jolt as the support vanished, her heart skipping a beat as she instinctively grasped for him.\n\nTheir bodies collided on the bed, her bathrobe teetering on the brink of decency, threatening to unravel with any minor shift.\n\nPropped on one elbow, Kristopher gazed down at her, his lips curled into a sly, teasing grin. \"You wanted to be let go, didn't you? So why cling to me now?\"\n\nHis eyes, deep and sparkling like a midnight lake speckled with stars, captivated her.\n\nIn those celestial depths, Carrie caught a glimpse of her own reflection.\n\nAt times like this, she was misled into believing he harbored a deep affection.\n\nSadly, his heart was a fortress reserved for Lise, and all Carrie had left were empty fantasies.\n\n\"Boring!\" she exclaimed, her voice devoid of any enthusiasm as she attempted to rise, her hand inadvertently brushing against something unexpected.\n\nThe following moment brought a noticeable shift in his cock pressing against her stomach.\n\n\"Don't move, or I can't promise what might happen next,\" he warned in a deep, gravelly voice.\n\nWith a frown, Carrie internally cursed upon hearing the statement.\n\nIt was an undeniable fact. Primal instincts steered the actions of men. Absence of affection didn't quell their basic desires.\n\nYet, she dared not agitate Kristopher. Angling her face away, her body remained rigid, frozen in place.\n\nCarrie, feeling irked, shot back. \"Didn't you say there's nothing here to see? What's with the reaction now, Mr. Norris? Are you really that easy to impress?\"\n\nNo sooner had her words flown than she grasped the potential repercussions of her sharp tongue.\n\nA wave of regret surged through Carrie, but instead of anger, Kristopher responded with a chuckle, \"You are my wife, after all. Since that's something I can't alter, I might as well embrace it. Besides, it's been years since we became husband and wife--it would be a shame to neglect you completely.\"\n\nChapter 4 Are You Out Of Your Mind?\nKristopher slipped his hand beneath the folds of her bathrobe, his touch tracing the curve of Carrie's skin, as smooth and delicate as silk. He encircled her slender waist, drawing her closer with a gentle yet firm grip.\n\nHer face, a captivating canvas of defiance and visible irritation, ignited in him an uncontrollable urge to claim victory over her resistance.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy, yet he remained composed, slowly removing his tailored suit.\n\nThe fabric of his suit brushed lightly against Carrie's cheek, releasing a mix of scents: a familiar woody aroma intertwined with an unexpected zesty twist of lemon. It was unmistakably Jo Malone's Blue Agava and Cacao--Lise's signature scent.\n\nA surge of nausea overwhelmed Carrie at the realization.\n\nAs Kristopher's eyes, now shaded with a stormy intensity, drew nearer to hers, the proximity conjured unwelcome visions of him with Lise. Her stomach churned violently, and with a sudden movement, she pushed him away, propping herself up with a jolt and a dry retch.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer stomach had been empty all day, leaving her with nothing to bring up.\n\nThe desire in Kristopher's gaze flickered out, replaced by a cold, detached expression as he withdrew slightly.\n\nObserving the genuine distress and the reddening of Carrie's eyes, Kristopher perceived her reaction for outright disgust at their closeness.\n\nHe paused, fingers adjusting his shirt cuffs, his voice cold as he confronted her. \"Carrie, is this reaction reserved only for me, or is it how you respond to all men?\"\n\nThe air in the room turned frosty, thick with tension.\n\nCarrie swallowed the sharp sting in her throat, her eyes widening in shock as she stared up at him.\n\nEver since their marriage, she had cut ties with nearly all her male friends, yet here was Kristopher, casually tossing out comments sharp enough to cut glass.\n\nThe years of love she had poured into their relationship now seemed utterly futile.\n\nHeat crept up her neck, coloring her cheeks a bright scarlet as indignation took hold. Without thinking, her hand flew up and delivered a stinging slap across Kristopher's face.\n\nAll her suppressed grievances from the day ignited in that swift motion.\n\nHer bathrobe, loosened in the heat of the moment, slipped from her shoulders. Ignoring the flush of exposure, she swiftly gathered the fabric and draped it around herself, her movements quick and firm.\n\nThe impact of her slap had left a light, crimson mark on Kristopher's cheek, marking him with her outrage.\n\nHis eyes, wide with disbelief, met hers. \"Carrie, are you out of your mind?\"\n\nOut of her mind? Yes, she was clearly insane to ever fall for him in the first place.\n\nCarrie fumed silently, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nSuddenly, the sharp buzz of the phone on the table cut through the mounting tension, its vibration bringing a brief respite from their standoff.\n\nKristopher cast a fleeting glance at the message, shut off the phone with a snap, and strode towards the door, his back rigid with tension.\n\nHer voice, firm and unwavering, chased after him. \"We're getting a divorce! Make sure you sign those papers before you walk out that door!\"\n\nKristopher paused briefly and said sharply, \"I have something to do now. When I return, do whatever pleases you.\" With that, he forcefully shut the door.\n\nCarrie's eyes followed his unwavering exit, feeling an oppressive weight compressing her chest once again.\n\nShe disregarded the sharp sting in her leg and hobbled determinedly toward her tablet. Fingers trembling, she hastily navigated to Lise's Twitter page.\n\nLise had just uploaded a new tweet.\n\nThe photo showed her lying down with a fever patch adhered to her forehead, still enveloped in Kristopher's familiar jacket.\n\nThe caption read, \"Being sick makes me extra clingy. Wishing I had someone here. Stay cozy and take care, everyone!\"\n\nThe simultaneous timing of these two events made it almost impossible for Carrie not to suspect that Kristopher had dashed off to tend to Lise.\n\nCarrie's instincts loudly proclaimed that this was no accident; Lise had deliberately sought to tug at Kristopher's heartstrings. It appeared her tactics were effective.\n\nNot even Carrie's stark threat of divorce could overshadow Lise's theatrical display of vulnerability.\n\nSeething with fury, Carrie quaked like a leaf swept into a storm.\n\nShe steeled herself against the heartache, forcefully ripping the plastic wrap from her aching leg.\n\nAfter her lengthy soak, the bath's lingering moisture had infiltrated her skin, inflaming the wound until it was a vivid, angry red and painfully swollen.\n\nShe, too, could be clingy. Even in the harshest times back in the county, she had shown vulnerability, breaking down into soft sobs within the comforting arms of her grandmother, especially that one time she got burned by the scalding kettle.\n\nBut such vulnerability had its time and place, and it wasn't now.\n\nThe stark reality of Kristopher's exit forced Carrie to confront her need for self-reliance.\n\nBiting down hard on her lip, Carrie cleaned the throbbing wound with a practiced hand before securely wrapping it anew.\n\nShe rose with a newfound resolve and yanked a black suitcase from the far end of her expansive walk-in closet--it held all the belongings she'd brought into this house as a hopeful bride.\n\nShe grabbed a fresh set of clothes to slip into and left a bank card neatly on the bedside table.\n\nShe had transferred every penny she'd earned over the past year onto that card, effectively settling her financial entanglements with Kristopher over the last two years and cutting him out of her life for good.\n\nDragging the heavy suitcase behind her, she limped painfully out of the opulent villa.\n\nAs she passed through the gate, she wrapped her baseball jacket more tightly around her slight figure, her silhouette hauntingly solitary in the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe night air of early spring was bitingly cold, devoid of any trace of warmth, a chill that seemed almost faint compared to the ice forming in Carrie's shattered heart.\n\nShe had arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a heart full of dreams, and now she was leaving, dreams crumbled, utterly alone.\n\nA bitter laugh slipped through her lips. If only she hadn't fallen so hard for him, if only she'd proposed an amicable separation at the end of their agreed year, maybe she wouldn't be wandering now, a lost soul in the shadow of her former self.\n\nLise didn't have to lift a finger, and Carrie had already fallen, utterly broken and beyond redemption.\n\nChapter 5 A Gathering\nMeanwhile, in the Oasis Club, renowned as the priciest spot in Orkset, the air within the VIP room crackled with excitement. Under the spell of bright lights and thumping music, a diverse group of men and women lounged together, basking in the exclusivity of the setting.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, revealing Kristopher in the doorway.\n\nThe karaoke session halted abruptly as the crowd turned to greet him in unison, voices mingling. \"Kristopher...\"\n\nBefore they could utter another word, a woman cloaked from head to toe stepped out from behind him.\n\nLise, with a fluid motion, removed her mask and slid her arm through Kristopher's. She addressed the room with a poised charm. \"My assistant took a sudden leave, and I found myself without company. Not keen on spending the evening alone, I invited Kristopher to join me. I trust that's alright?\"\n\nLise's beauty was without question. Her face was a delicate composition of cherry lips and a sculpted nose, framed by eyes that shimmered with a vulnerable allure, commanding a protective fervor from those around her--her presence, ethereal.\n\nIn contrast, Carrie's features were more pronounced, her beauty vivid and striking. Lise, by comparison, carried a softer, more understated elegance.\n\nYet, as it often goes, matters of the heart followed no simple paths.\n\nWhile Kristopher and Carrie were married, it was in name only; Kristopher seemed detached and seldom included her in private social events.\n\nThe group didn't have much of a relationship with Carrie, leading them to feel no obligation to defend her.\n\nUpon hearing Lise's comment, a moment of discomfort rippled through the air. Nonetheless, they quickly recovered, offering a congenial smile as they said, \"We're all friends here; let's not bother with formalities.\"\n\nLise offered a subtle, knowing smile, as she gracefully accompanied Kristopher into the bustling room.\n\nThe event that evening had been meticulously planned to express appreciation for Kristopher's contributions.\n\nAs they stepped into the room, the crowd parted like the sea, making way for them to proceed to the seats of honor.\n\nThe group's leader handed Kristopher a glass of wine with a flourish, proclaiming with a broad grin, \"We truly owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Norris! Your exceptional talents are the talk of the town, and witnessing them firsthand today only confirms it. Without your expertise, securing this contract would have been a fantasy!\"\n\nTheir gathering marked the launch of a novel shopping platform, one that had been in negotiation with numerous local brands in Orkset. But the scenario changed dramatically when the tech giant JoyBuy dramatically entered the scene, stirring up the competitive landscape.\n\nCompeting with JoyBuy was akin to the classic David versus Goliath tale--hopelessly daunting. In a surge of desperation, they turned to Kristopher, reaching out through a network of connections for his renowned strategic prowess.\n\nWith his characteristic swiftness, Kristopher hatched an ingenious plan and swiftly secured the deal, snatching it from the clutches of JoyBuy right before the business association could ink their agreement--a masterful coup that reverberated success.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround only intensified the already deep respect everyone held for Kristopher.\n\nAlbin Murray, beaming with pride, couldn't help but boast, \"Ah, just look at the caliber of his friends! They thought they could steal deals right under our noses, obviously underestimating Kristopher's clout!\"\n\nAlbin, born into the wealthy Murray family, counted himself among Kristopher's closest friends. He was renowned for his sprawling social web--a network through which the desperate plea for help was channeled to Kristopher.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristopher himself, the focus of all their discussions, reclined nonchalantly on the couch, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe was well-versed in the art of receiving compliments; thus, his expression stayed calm and detached.\n\nThe ambient light sculpted his angular features, casting dramatic shadows that emphasized his high nose bridge and sharply cut jawline, as though he were a living masterpiece.\n\nHis natural grace and detachment eclipsed any terrestrial magnificence.\n\nFollowing a sequence of celebratory toasts, when it became apparent that Kristopher merely touched his glass without truly drinking, the rest of the company toned down their conversation, allowing him a moment of repose with his eyes gently shut.\n\nLise, slightly feverish, opted not to indulge in the spirits, choosing instead to sit in serene silence next to Kristopher, her eyes lingering on him with a look of deep, unmistakable adoration.\n\nAlbin, captivated by the seemingly perfect pair, pondered the whims of destiny. He discreetly captured their image with his smartphone and nonchalantly shared it across his social networks.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the liquor dwindled, the room's door swung open anew.\n\nKristopher's personal assistant, Oliver Brooks, made his entrance, acknowledging the gathering with a courteous nod that bordered on respect but avoided groveling, swiftly positioning himself in front of Kristopher.\n\nSilence hung in the air, yet Lise, unable to contain her curiosity, leaned in and whispered, \"What's going on?\"\n\nOliver, maintaining his focus on Kristopher, chose not to respond directly to her.\n\nA flush of embarrassment tinted Lise's cheeks as she turned towards Kristopher, hesitatingly inquiring, \"Should I leave?\"\n\nKristopher adjusted his posture, his voice low and calm as he instructed, \"Go ahead, speak.\"\n\nA shiver of apprehension coursed through Oliver as he tentatively began, \"Mr. Norris, Mrs. Norris has departed from Bayview Villa, and...\"\n\n&9&\n0:00 / 4:55",

        "primary_text": "\"He finally remembered the woman waiting for him at home, only to face her divorce papers. Confident she'd regret it, he signed. But post-divorce, she blossomed, turning heads everywhere. Defeated, he begged to win her back!\n=====\nIn the bustling, weathered heart of Orkset, flames erupted violently within an ancient apartment building. Propelled by gusts of wind, the fire devoured the structure, belching dense smoke and bright, searing tongues of flame.\n\n\"Saved! They've been saved.\" The words echoed amidst the chaos.\n\nFirefighters emerged from the smoldering inferno, carrying Carrie Campbell to safety at the roadside.\n\nHer features, usually refined and expressive, were now smeared with soot; her sparkling eyes dimmed to a vacant gaze, hollow and lost.\n\nAs reality seeped back into her consciousness, Carrie felt a rush of gratitude overpower her usual composure. Her voice, hoarse and weak, conveyed a profound \"thank you\" to her rescuers. Shaking, she fumbled for her phone, her fingertips quivering as they found the familiar number.\n\n\"Hello, the person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe automated message played after a few rings, leaving her with a lump in her throat, her unvoiced frustrations and sorrow welling up inside her.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a deafening roar, the explosion abruptly silenced the cold, mechanical voice echoing through the line. Carrie's head snapped upwards, shock painted on her face as she witnessed the apartment she had just exited erupt into flames.\n\nChunks of debris were hurled into the air by the force of the blast, scattering across the sky.\n\nPanic engulfed the crowd as survivors, freshly rescued, screamed in terror. They huddled together, seeking solace in each other's arms, their cries piercing the tumultuous scene. In stark contrast, Carrie lay alone on a stretcher, her isolation magnified amidst the chaos.\n\n\"Kristopher...\" Fighting the dread creeping up her spine, Carrie pressed her lips together tightly and dialed her husband's number again, her resolve unwavering.\n\nYet, the call disconnected after a few short rings, leaving her with a haunting silence.\n\nJust then, a Twitter notification flickered on her phone screen.\n\nThe gossip feed was alive with the latest gossip: #LiseNash #MysteriouBoyfriend.\n\nAccording to the tweet, a producer from a well-known variety show had invited the renowned star Lise Nash to a dinner, which had quickly soured when she declined to partake in a toast.\n\nThis act of defiance had sparked a confrontation, only to be interrupted by Lise's domineering boyfriend. He stormed into the private dining room, dismissing the producer with a dismissive wave and escorting Lise away.\n\nThe tweet described the scene vividly, painting a picture of a powerful man defending his beloved partner.\n\nYet, perhaps due to his prominence, only the back of the man was visible in the accompanying photos, preserving his anonymity. Meanwhile, Lise, donning an oversized suit jacket, beamed a smile, reaching out to clasp his hand as they departed together.\n\nCarrie's eyes were glued to the screen, her stare intense and unblinking as she absorbed the image before her.\n\nThere he was--Kristopher Norris!\n\nThe suit jacket draped carelessly over Lise was a dead giveaway.\n\nEvery piece of clothing Kristopher owned had been meticulously tailored by a master craftsman abroad, a detail Carrie knew all too well.\n\nHer grip on her phone tightened, her knuckles blanching to a stark white, as if her very soul were being squeezed by an invisible hand, the pain sharp and acid-like in its intensity.\n\nIn her most desperate moment, Kristopher had coldly disconnected their call, choosing instead to be at Lise's side.\n\nWhat was the worth of their two-year marriage?\n\nThe tears she had been holding back now overwhelmed her, streaming down her face.\n\nEven as she tilted her head back in a futile attempt to stem the flow, the tears continued to escape.\n\nLise had always been Kristopher's first love, a fact whispered and gossiped about among their circles. The Norris family had never approved of Lise, seeing her ordinary background as unfitting.\n\nForced apart by family pressures, it had been Lise who ended things, but the past, it seemed, was not easily left behind.\n\nKristopher had diligently pursued the leadership of the Norris family, harboring dreams of finally being with Lise.\n\nYet, when he reached his goal, he discovered that Lise had already chosen another.\n\nIn defiance of his family's expectations and perhaps out of bitterness, Kristopher turned to Carrie, a woman equally devoid of wealth or status, to become Mrs. Norris, thereby blocking any matchmaking attempts by his relatives.\n\nAt that time, Carrie faced immense pressure from her father, Tristan Campbell, who was pushing her towards a marriage with a playboy, the son of a business associate, to cover her grandmother's steep medical expenses.\n\nBoth Kristopher and Carrie, driven by their personal motives, consented to a marriage of convenience.\n\nOriginally set for just one year, their contractual marriage stretched beyond its term, sustained by a shared understanding between them.\n\nOver time, Carrie began to believe in the authenticity of their union, never suspecting that it was merely an extension of her hopes.\n\nJust moments ago, a fire had nearly claimed Carrie's life. In that critical moment, she reached out to Kristopher, only to be twice rebuffed as he spent his time with Lise.\n\nThis harsh reality shattered Carrie's illusions, revealing that her perceived transition from pretense to genuine relationship was nothing but a facade maintained by her own desires.\n\nCarrie wasn't even a temporary substitute in Kristopher's life but merely a pawn used to spite his family.\n\nAfter a poignant pause, tears welled up in Carrie's eyes, unstoppable and poignant.\n\nIt might be time for her to release herself from the shackles of her own hopeful delusions--to stop deceiving herself.\n\nChapter 2 Trending Topics\nThe overwhelming number of injuries from the fire was staggering, straining the already frantic doctors and nurses as they tried to provide aid.\n\nCarrie had been merely grazed by a splintered clothes rack, which left a deep, jagged wound on her calf. In comparison to the chaos around her, her wounds seemed almost negligible.\n\nShe managed to get basic care--a brisk cleaning and a quick wrap of bandages--at a local hospital before catching a cab back to her house.\n\nBayview Villa, a grand property under Kristopher's name, was technically their matrimonial residence.\n\nLiving alone had become the norm for Carrie, as Kristopher was hardly ever around. She had bid farewell to the housekeeper, discovering that her life could be quite adequately maintained with just takeout, deliveries, and the occasional visit from a part-time cleaner.\n\nNow, she found herself the sole occupant of the sprawling living room, sinking into the sofa, her gaze drifting across the empty space.\n\nThe stark, monochrome decor did nothing to imbue warmth into the atmosphere.\n\nA chilling realization crept up on her: this vast, elegant space felt more like a colossal tomb, a silent grave for her lost years of youth and a love that had quietly slipped away.\n\nIn this cold, echoing house, would anyone even notice if her breath ceased one day?\n\nCarrie exhaled a weary sigh, her frame heavy as she leaned against the cold wall for support, struggling up the stairs to her bedroom on the second floor.\n\nEach step was a battle, sending stabbing pains shooting through her from the surface of her skin down to her aching bones.\n\nThe house, stark and hollow, echoed even the smallest sounds, magnifying her sense of isolation.\n\nIt was today, amidst this profound silence, that Carrie truly grasped the all-encompassing nature of her loneliness--it was almost tangible, enveloping her senses with its texture and mournful whispers, tightening around her heart like a vice, producing a dull, relentless ache.\n\nUpon reaching the sanctuary of her bedroom, she collapsed onto the bed, the very embodiment of exhaustion, feeling it both physically and spiritually.\n\nJust as she surrendered to this weariness, the sharp ring of the phone pierced the silence.\n\n\"You reached out to me earlier. What do you need?\" Kristopher's voice cut through the line, cold and distant as ever.\n\nCarrie was caught off guard by his unexpected call. Words failed her as she parted her lips to respond, but before she could collect her thoughts, a soft, feminine voice floated through from the other end. \"Kristopher, will you join me to...\"\n\nA surge of emotions tightened Carrie's grip on the phone, her heart thumping louder with each second. Overwhelmed and unable to contain her rising panic, she demanded, \"Who's there with you?\"\n\nKristopher gave no answer, merely stating in a flat, disinterested voice, \"If there's something you need, let's catch up when I'm back. I have pressing engagements right now, so I must disconnect.\"\n\nHe promptly ended the call, cutting off any chance for Carrie to reply.\n\nAs the harsh beep of the disconnected line filled her ears, Carrie's lips twisted into a rueful grin. How utterly foolish she felt! Deep down, she knew his response all too well, yet she had clung to the hope of hearing his voice confirm it.\n\nWith a sense of self-inflicted irony, Carrie activated her tablet and scrolled through the day's hot topics.\n\nOne headline caught her eye: \"A female star shielded from harassment at a dinner by her formidable partner.\" A wry smile twisted her lips.\n\nCarrie knew all too well what it was like to face harassment at those kinds of dinners.\n\nShe vividly remembered her first major audition after her entering the showbiz; her agent had escorted her to a dinner with the influential director and producer of the drama series \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nAs a novice in the dizzying world of showbiz, Carrie had felt incredibly vulnerable, uncertain of how to navigate the murky waters of such gatherings.\n\nThe producer had eyed her shamelessly, sneering as he asked, \"Is this the new talent you're introducing? She appears presentable, but I'm curious to see how she fares with a drink. Here's the deal, if you can gulp down this bottle in one go, I'll secure you an audition for the lead role.\"\n\nCarrie was inclined to decline, but under the relentless pressure from her agent, she found herself compelled to consume the entire bottle.\n\nAs the evening wore on, she was hurriedly taken to the hospital suffering from a severe stomach ailment.\n\nHer agent, fretful about the prospect of the role slipping away to another, quickly settled the hospital charges and departed.\n\nAt that time, Carrie found herself isolated in a hospital bed for several long days.\n\nYet, even before Carrie could be released from the hospital, the media was abuzz with the announcement that Lise had secured the lead role in \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nSubsequently, her agent rebuked Carrie for her lack of ambition, complaining, \"You are more appealing than Lise, so why can't you show more drive? She cozied up to Mr. Norris and hardly had to make an effort. She's surrounded by people eager to cater to her every need. I've heard that Mr. Norris personally orchestrated her landing the lead role in this production!\"\n\nWhen the show premiered, Lise was catapulted into stardom, swiftly ascending to the elite echelons of the acting world.\n\nFrom that moment forward, Carrie let her acting aspirations wane and chose instead to devote herself entirely to supporting her husband, Kristopher.\n\nAfter all, no matter her efforts, she could never get the same career opportunities that Lise seemed to receive effortlessly with Kristopher's offhand remarks.\n\nAt that time, Carrie had believed she was filling the role that was meant to be Lise's as Mrs. Norris, which meant she owed Lise.\n\nBy giving up the career opportunities to Lise, Carrie thought they would settle their unspoken debt.\n\nHowever, Carrie hadn't foreseen that Lise would claim both the coveted career and Kristopher's affections.\n\nAs Lise's professional and love life blossomed, Carrie came to the painful realization that she had been overly consumed with her romantic pursuits, at the expense of her career, and now, she found herself bereft of both love and professional fulfillment.\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Carrie viewed her past two years as tragically misguided.\n\nGiven another opportunity, she resolved she wouldn't be so unguarded, letting her heart recklessly fall captive to Kristopher's charm.\n\n\"Ms. Spencer, the new copyright contract is prepared. Please review it for any discrepancies.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed with the alert, snapping Carrie out of her reverie. She gazed at the PDF file attached in the message, her mind briefly overwhelmed.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Katrina Spencer, Carrie had once made a name for herself as a budding screenwriter, selling numerous scripts in her early days.\n\nDuring her early career as Katrina, Carrie often sold her work for a pittance, compelled by her urgent need for immediate cash.\n\nOver the years, these scripts transformed into blockbuster films and hit series, catapulting Katrina's reputation to new heights.\n\nBy this time, Carrie had married Kristopher and was no longer plagued by the financial woes that had once driven her to desperation--her grandmother's hefty medical bills were a thing of the past. With her financial crises resolved, Carrie's life had pivoted to domestic responsibilities, striving to be an exemplary wife to Kristopher. Amidst these changes, her pseudonym, Katrina Spencer, gradually receded into the background.\n\nHowever, her past as Katrina wasn't ready to be shelved just yet. Recently, an interested buyer had come forward, ready to pay a handsome sum for one of her old scripts.\n\nCarrie, however, was hesitant to sell. She raised several concerns about the contract presented to her, and to her astonishment, the buyer was genuine enough to revise it accordingly.\n\nHolding the revised contract in her hands, Carrie inhaled deeply, her resolve hardening. She seemed to have reached a crucial decision.\n\nHer fingers danced over her phone's keyboard with swift precision, typing out a firm command. \"Create a divorce agreement following my terms and ensure it reaches Kristopher Norris at the Norris Group.\"\n\nWithout pausing for a response, she placed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step echoing a blend of determination and newfound independence.\n\nChapter 3 Exchange Of Conveniences\nThirty minutes had passed, Carrie finally heaved herself up from the bathtub, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. As she lifted her gaze, her own image in the mirror halted her movements--her skin appeared as smooth and impeccable as fine porcelain, glowing with an unblemished radiance.\n\nHer eyes, deep pools of allure, sparkled with an enchanting, soft warmth, inviting anyone who dared meet her gaze.\n\nDespite edging into her late twenties at twenty-five, she reveled in the fact that time had yet to etch its marks upon her flawless complexion.\n\nSurely, a woman with such a visage had no place for self-pity.\n\nAbsorbed in her contemplation, Carrie carelessly extended her right leg onto the cold floor, forgetting it was the very limb she had injured. Wrapped excessively in cling film to shield it from moisture, the tight encasement had stifled her circulation, rendering her leg eerily numb. As her foot touched down, it betrayed her, slipping forward unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Carrie gasped, her arms flailing in a frantic ballet, searching for a lifeline in the void.\n\nJust as she teetered on the brink of a painful rendezvous with the floor, the bathroom door burst open.\n\nKristopher stood at the entrance, his suit immaculately tailored, creating a striking figure. As their eyes locked, he paused, visibly taken aback, then quickly closed the distance with brisk strides.\n\nCarrie's breath caught as Kristopher swept her up in a graceful bridal style, an unexpected tightness wrapping around her waist. Caught off guard by his sudden appearance, Carrie realized with a jolt that she was completely bare. A flush of embarrassment washed over her as she instinctively clutched her hands over her chest.\n\nThis was their first moment of such intimacy since their wedding, and the discomfort made her toes curl inward, her skin blushing a delicate shade of pink.\n\nKristopher looked down at her with a mischievous grin. \"Let's be honest, there's not much to see,\" he teased gently.\n\nFeeling both mortified and slightly irritated, Carrie snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Norris, after all you've seen, I suppose nothing can impress you anymore.\"\n\nShe carried her C-cup curves with understated charm, a touch of sensuality that outshone Lise's painfully flat, almost awkwardly rigid build.\n\nYet Carrie knew well that without love, even the most perfect physique paled in comparison to the charm of one dearly cherished.\n\nNonchalantly, Kristopher reached for a bathrobe hanging behind the door and draped it over her. His frown deepened at her comment. \"What are you talking about, Carrie?\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike him, and his expression grew even more impatient. \"Tell me, did you send those divorce papers in the dead of night just to lure me back here--to catch you completely bare?\" His tone was a mix of disbelief and annoyance. \"I told you I was swamped with work. Was this dramatic display really necessary?\"\n\nCarrie's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the tension between them. He was always so quick to lose patience with her.\n\nShe wasn't the type to throw around words like divorce or breakups lightly. In fact, this was the first time she'd ever mentioned divorce in their two-year marriage, yet he seemed indifferent to her turmoil. He simply dismissed her concerns as if she were overreacting about trivial matters.\n\nDespite the throbbing pain in her leg, Carrie mustered her strength and said, \"Put me down.\"\n\nKristopher, however, paid no heed, his eyes scanning her leg swathed in bandages. His brow furrowed slightly. \"What happened to your leg? Is this some elaborate ploy to lure me back?\"\n\nAt his words, a bitter laugh escaped Carrie.\n\nIt seemed he viewed her as merely seeking attention, and in failing to capture it, she had likely concocted a story to draw him back, allowing her to dramatize her plight in his presence.\n\nWith a blank face, she replied untruthfully, \"It's a beauty treatment that shouldn't get wet.\"\n\n\"Why did you suddenly decide to undergo such a treatment?\" Kristopher inquired, his tone casual as he carried her outside, not pressing the issue further.\n\nHis frame was large, and through his thin shirt, she could distinctly feel the warmth of his body and the defined shape of his chest muscles.\n\nThe closeness created an uncomfortable tension for Carrie, who had resolved to end things once and for all.\n\nHer voice climbed involuntarily, sharper this time. \"Oh, since when have you been concerned with such minor things, Mr. Norris?\"\n\nFor the first time, Kristopher witnessed her using biting sarcasm; it struck him as peculiarly amusing. With a calm demeanor, he responded, \"You're my wife, it's only natural I'd be concerned about your well-being.\"\n\n\"Really?\" There was a somber note in Carrie's voice now. \"It seems like you've never really regarded me as your wife. I'm scared that if I were to die, you wouldn't even know until much later.\"\n\nAfter all, at that very moment, Kristopher had been distracted, lost in moments with his first love, too consumed to lend an ear to her desperate pleas.\n\nCaught off guard by her accusation, Kristopher's eyes widened with surprise before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. \"Carrie, what's brought on this sudden outburst of anger? Just because I was tied up this afternoon and missed your call? Perhaps I've been too indulgent with you lately, and it's made you a bit too presumptuous?\"\n\nCarrie froze, startled. Was he accusing her of being too presumptuous?\n\nShe realized their marriage had always been lopsided. In his eyes, she was nothing more than a transactional partner, a woman who had bartered her freedom for financial security.\n\nTheir union was meant to be a mere exchange of conveniences, yet she had, quite foolishly, fallen deeply in love with him.\n\nIn the tricky terrain of romance, the one who fell first invariably found themselves at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nKristopher's dismissive reaction left Carrie reeling, her emotions dismissed as trifles, a tight knot of suffocation rising in her chest.\n\n\"I said to put me down this instant!\" Carrie exclaimed, jerking her head to the side, her voice laced with a sharp edge of impatience.\n\nKristopher remained mute, effortlessly carrying her towards the bed before suddenly releasing his hold.\n\nCarrie felt a jolt as the support vanished, her heart skipping a beat as she instinctively grasped for him.\n\nTheir bodies collided on the bed, her bathrobe teetering on the brink of decency, threatening to unravel with any minor shift.\n\nPropped on one elbow, Kristopher gazed down at her, his lips curled into a sly, teasing grin. \"You wanted to be let go, didn't you? So why cling to me now?\"\n\nHis eyes, deep and sparkling like a midnight lake speckled with stars, captivated her.\n\nIn those celestial depths, Carrie caught a glimpse of her own reflection.\n\nAt times like this, she was misled into believing he harbored a deep affection.\n\nSadly, his heart was a fortress reserved for Lise, and all Carrie had left were empty fantasies.\n\n\"Boring!\" she exclaimed, her voice devoid of any enthusiasm as she attempted to rise, her hand inadvertently brushing against something unexpected.\n\nThe following moment brought a noticeable shift in his cock pressing against her stomach.\n\n\"Don't move, or I can't promise what might happen next,\" he warned in a deep, gravelly voice.\n\nWith a frown, Carrie internally cursed upon hearing the statement.\n\nIt was an undeniable fact. Primal instincts steered the actions of men. Absence of affection didn't quell their basic desires.\n\nYet, she dared not agitate Kristopher. Angling her face away, her body remained rigid, frozen in place.\n\nCarrie, feeling irked, shot back. \"Didn't you say there's nothing here to see? What's with the reaction now, Mr. Norris? Are you really that easy to impress?\"\n\nNo sooner had her words flown than she grasped the potential repercussions of her sharp tongue.\n\nA wave of regret surged through Carrie, but instead of anger, Kristopher responded with a chuckle, \"You are my wife, after all. Since that's something I can't alter, I might as well embrace it. Besides, it's been years since we became husband and wife--it would be a shame to neglect you completely.\"\n\nChapter 4 Are You Out Of Your Mind?\nKristopher slipped his hand beneath the folds of her bathrobe, his touch tracing the curve of Carrie's skin, as smooth and delicate as silk. He encircled her slender waist, drawing her closer with a gentle yet firm grip.\n\nHer face, a captivating canvas of defiance and visible irritation, ignited in him an uncontrollable urge to claim victory over her resistance.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy, yet he remained composed, slowly removing his tailored suit.\n\nThe fabric of his suit brushed lightly against Carrie's cheek, releasing a mix of scents: a familiar woody aroma intertwined with an unexpected zesty twist of lemon. It was unmistakably Jo Malone's Blue Agava and Cacao--Lise's signature scent.\n\nA surge of nausea overwhelmed Carrie at the realization.\n\nAs Kristopher's eyes, now shaded with a stormy intensity, drew nearer to hers, the proximity conjured unwelcome visions of him with Lise. Her stomach churned violently, and with a sudden movement, she pushed him away, propping herself up with a jolt and a dry retch.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer stomach had been empty all day, leaving her with nothing to bring up.\n\nThe desire in Kristopher's gaze flickered out, replaced by a cold, detached expression as he withdrew slightly.\n\nObserving the genuine distress and the reddening of Carrie's eyes, Kristopher perceived her reaction for outright disgust at their closeness.\n\nHe paused, fingers adjusting his shirt cuffs, his voice cold as he confronted her. \"Carrie, is this reaction reserved only for me, or is it how you respond to all men?\"\n\nThe air in the room turned frosty, thick with tension.\n\nCarrie swallowed the sharp sting in her throat, her eyes widening in shock as she stared up at him.\n\nEver since their marriage, she had cut ties with nearly all her male friends, yet here was Kristopher, casually tossing out comments sharp enough to cut glass.\n\nThe years of love she had poured into their relationship now seemed utterly futile.\n\nHeat crept up her neck, coloring her cheeks a bright scarlet as indignation took hold. Without thinking, her hand flew up and delivered a stinging slap across Kristopher's face.\n\nAll her suppressed grievances from the day ignited in that swift motion.\n\nHer bathrobe, loosened in the heat of the moment, slipped from her shoulders. Ignoring the flush of exposure, she swiftly gathered the fabric and draped it around herself, her movements quick and firm.\n\nThe impact of her slap had left a light, crimson mark on Kristopher's cheek, marking him with her outrage.\n\nHis eyes, wide with disbelief, met hers. \"Carrie, are you out of your mind?\"\n\nOut of her mind? Yes, she was clearly insane to ever fall for him in the first place.\n\nCarrie fumed silently, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nSuddenly, the sharp buzz of the phone on the table cut through the mounting tension, its vibration bringing a brief respite from their standoff.\n\nKristopher cast a fleeting glance at the message, shut off the phone with a snap, and strode towards the door, his back rigid with tension.\n\nHer voice, firm and unwavering, chased after him. \"We're getting a divorce! Make sure you sign those papers before you walk out that door!\"\n\nKristopher paused briefly and said sharply, \"I have something to do now. When I return, do whatever pleases you.\" With that, he forcefully shut the door.\n\nCarrie's eyes followed his unwavering exit, feeling an oppressive weight compressing her chest once again.\n\nShe disregarded the sharp sting in her leg and hobbled determinedly toward her tablet. Fingers trembling, she hastily navigated to Lise's Twitter page.\n\nLise had just uploaded a new tweet.\n\nThe photo showed her lying down with a fever patch adhered to her forehead, still enveloped in Kristopher's familiar jacket.\n\nThe caption read, \"Being sick makes me extra clingy. Wishing I had someone here. Stay cozy and take care, everyone!\"\n\nThe simultaneous timing of these two events made it almost impossible for Carrie not to suspect that Kristopher had dashed off to tend to Lise.\n\nCarrie's instincts loudly proclaimed that this was no accident; Lise had deliberately sought to tug at Kristopher's heartstrings. It appeared her tactics were effective.\n\nNot even Carrie's stark threat of divorce could overshadow Lise's theatrical display of vulnerability.\n\nSeething with fury, Carrie quaked like a leaf swept into a storm.\n\nShe steeled herself against the heartache, forcefully ripping the plastic wrap from her aching leg.\n\nAfter her lengthy soak, the bath's lingering moisture had infiltrated her skin, inflaming the wound until it was a vivid, angry red and painfully swollen.\n\nShe, too, could be clingy. Even in the harshest times back in the county, she had shown vulnerability, breaking down into soft sobs within the comforting arms of her grandmother, especially that one time she got burned by the scalding kettle.\n\nBut such vulnerability had its time and place, and it wasn't now.\n\nThe stark reality of Kristopher's exit forced Carrie to confront her need for self-reliance.\n\nBiting down hard on her lip, Carrie cleaned the throbbing wound with a practiced hand before securely wrapping it anew.\n\nShe rose with a newfound resolve and yanked a black suitcase from the far end of her expansive walk-in closet--it held all the belongings she'd brought into this house as a hopeful bride.\n\nShe grabbed a fresh set of clothes to slip into and left a bank card neatly on the bedside table.\n\nShe had transferred every penny she'd earned over the past year onto that card, effectively settling her financial entanglements with Kristopher over the last two years and cutting him out of her life for good.\n\nDragging the heavy suitcase behind her, she limped painfully out of the opulent villa.\n\nAs she passed through the gate, she wrapped her baseball jacket more tightly around her slight figure, her silhouette hauntingly solitary in the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe night air of early spring was bitingly cold, devoid of any trace of warmth, a chill that seemed almost faint compared to the ice forming in Carrie's shattered heart.\n\nShe had arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a heart full of dreams, and now she was leaving, dreams crumbled, utterly alone.\n\nA bitter laugh slipped through her lips. If only she hadn't fallen so hard for him, if only she'd proposed an amicable separation at the end of their agreed year, maybe she wouldn't be wandering now, a lost soul in the shadow of her former self.\n\nLise didn't have to lift a finger, and Carrie had already fallen, utterly broken and beyond redemption.\n\nChapter 5 A Gathering\nMeanwhile, in the Oasis Club, renowned as the priciest spot in Orkset, the air within the VIP room crackled with excitement. Under the spell of bright lights and thumping music, a diverse group of men and women lounged together, basking in the exclusivity of the setting.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, revealing Kristopher in the doorway.\n\nThe karaoke session halted abruptly as the crowd turned to greet him in unison, voices mingling. \"Kristopher...\"\n\nBefore they could utter another word, a woman cloaked from head to toe stepped out from behind him.\n\nLise, with a fluid motion, removed her mask and slid her arm through Kristopher's. She addressed the room with a poised charm. \"My assistant took a sudden leave, and I found myself without company. Not keen on spending the evening alone, I invited Kristopher to join me. I trust that's alright?\"\n\nLise's beauty was without question. Her face was a delicate composition of cherry lips and a sculpted nose, framed by eyes that shimmered with a vulnerable allure, commanding a protective fervor from those around her--her presence, ethereal.\n\nIn contrast, Carrie's features were more pronounced, her beauty vivid and striking. Lise, by comparison, carried a softer, more understated elegance.\n\nYet, as it often goes, matters of the heart followed no simple paths.\n\nWhile Kristopher and Carrie were married, it was in name only; Kristopher seemed detached and seldom included her in private social events.\n\nThe group didn't have much of a relationship with Carrie, leading them to feel no obligation to defend her.\n\nUpon hearing Lise's comment, a moment of discomfort rippled through the air. Nonetheless, they quickly recovered, offering a congenial smile as they said, \"We're all friends here; let's not bother with formalities.\"\n\nLise offered a subtle, knowing smile, as she gracefully accompanied Kristopher into the bustling room.\n\nThe event that evening had been meticulously planned to express appreciation for Kristopher's contributions.\n\nAs they stepped into the room, the crowd parted like the sea, making way for them to proceed to the seats of honor.\n\nThe group's leader handed Kristopher a glass of wine with a flourish, proclaiming with a broad grin, \"We truly owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Norris! Your exceptional talents are the talk of the town, and witnessing them firsthand today only confirms it. Without your expertise, securing this contract would have been a fantasy!\"\n\nTheir gathering marked the launch of a novel shopping platform, one that had been in negotiation with numerous local brands in Orkset. But the scenario changed dramatically when the tech giant JoyBuy dramatically entered the scene, stirring up the competitive landscape.\n\nCompeting with JoyBuy was akin to the classic David versus Goliath tale--hopelessly daunting. In a surge of desperation, they turned to Kristopher, reaching out through a network of connections for his renowned strategic prowess.\n\nWith his characteristic swiftness, Kristopher hatched an ingenious plan and swiftly secured the deal, snatching it from the clutches of JoyBuy right before the business association could ink their agreement--a masterful coup that reverberated success.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround only intensified the already deep respect everyone held for Kristopher.\n\nAlbin Murray, beaming with pride, couldn't help but boast, \"Ah, just look at the caliber of his friends! They thought they could steal deals right under our noses, obviously underestimating Kristopher's clout!\"\n\nAlbin, born into the wealthy Murray family, counted himself among Kristopher's closest friends. He was renowned for his sprawling social web--a network through which the desperate plea for help was channeled to Kristopher.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristopher himself, the focus of all their discussions, reclined nonchalantly on the couch, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe was well-versed in the art of receiving compliments; thus, his expression stayed calm and detached.\n\nThe ambient light sculpted his angular features, casting dramatic shadows that emphasized his high nose bridge and sharply cut jawline, as though he were a living masterpiece.\n\nHis natural grace and detachment eclipsed any terrestrial magnificence.\n\nFollowing a sequence of celebratory toasts, when it became apparent that Kristopher merely touched his glass without truly drinking, the rest of the company toned down their conversation, allowing him a moment of repose with his eyes gently shut.\n\nLise, slightly feverish, opted not to indulge in the spirits, choosing instead to sit in serene silence next to Kristopher, her eyes lingering on him with a look of deep, unmistakable adoration.\n\nAlbin, captivated by the seemingly perfect pair, pondered the whims of destiny. He discreetly captured their image with his smartphone and nonchalantly shared it across his social networks.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the liquor dwindled, the room's door swung open anew.\n\nKristopher's personal assistant, Oliver Brooks, made his entrance, acknowledging the gathering with a courteous nod that bordered on respect but avoided groveling, swiftly positioning himself in front of Kristopher.\n\nSilence hung in the air, yet Lise, unable to contain her curiosity, leaned in and whispered, \"What's going on?\"\n\nOliver, maintaining his focus on Kristopher, chose not to respond directly to her.\n\nA flush of embarrassment tinted Lise's cheeks as she turned towards Kristopher, hesitatingly inquiring, \"Should I leave?\"\n\nKristopher adjusted his posture, his voice low and calm as he instructed, \"Go ahead, speak.\"\n\nA shiver of apprehension coursed through Oliver as he tentatively began, \"Mr. Norris, Mrs. Norris has departed from Bayview Villa, and...\"\n\n&9&\n0:00 / 4:50",

        "primary_text": "\"He finally remembered the woman waiting for him at home, only to face her divorce papers. Confident she'd regret it, he signed. But post-divorce, she blossomed, turning heads everywhere. Defeated, he begged to win her back!\n=====\nIn the bustling, weathered heart of Orkset, flames erupted violently within an ancient apartment building. Propelled by gusts of wind, the fire devoured the structure, belching dense smoke and bright, searing tongues of flame.\n\n\"Saved! They've been saved.\" The words echoed amidst the chaos.\n\nFirefighters emerged from the smoldering inferno, carrying Carrie Campbell to safety at the roadside.\n\nHer features, usually refined and expressive, were now smeared with soot; her sparkling eyes dimmed to a vacant gaze, hollow and lost.\n\nAs reality seeped back into her consciousness, Carrie felt a rush of gratitude overpower her usual composure. Her voice, hoarse and weak, conveyed a profound \"thank you\" to her rescuers. Shaking, she fumbled for her phone, her fingertips quivering as they found the familiar number.\n\n\"Hello, the person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe automated message played after a few rings, leaving her with a lump in her throat, her unvoiced frustrations and sorrow welling up inside her.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a deafening roar, the explosion abruptly silenced the cold, mechanical voice echoing through the line. Carrie's head snapped upwards, shock painted on her face as she witnessed the apartment she had just exited erupt into flames.\n\nChunks of debris were hurled into the air by the force of the blast, scattering across the sky.\n\nPanic engulfed the crowd as survivors, freshly rescued, screamed in terror. They huddled together, seeking solace in each other's arms, their cries piercing the tumultuous scene. In stark contrast, Carrie lay alone on a stretcher, her isolation magnified amidst the chaos.\n\n\"Kristopher...\" Fighting the dread creeping up her spine, Carrie pressed her lips together tightly and dialed her husband's number again, her resolve unwavering.\n\nYet, the call disconnected after a few short rings, leaving her with a haunting silence.\n\nJust then, a Twitter notification flickered on her phone screen.\n\nThe gossip feed was alive with the latest gossip: #LiseNash #MysteriouBoyfriend.\n\nAccording to the tweet, a producer from a well-known variety show had invited the renowned star Lise Nash to a dinner, which had quickly soured when she declined to partake in a toast.\n\nThis act of defiance had sparked a confrontation, only to be interrupted by Lise's domineering boyfriend. He stormed into the private dining room, dismissing the producer with a dismissive wave and escorting Lise away.\n\nThe tweet described the scene vividly, painting a picture of a powerful man defending his beloved partner.\n\nYet, perhaps due to his prominence, only the back of the man was visible in the accompanying photos, preserving his anonymity. Meanwhile, Lise, donning an oversized suit jacket, beamed a smile, reaching out to clasp his hand as they departed together.\n\nCarrie's eyes were glued to the screen, her stare intense and unblinking as she absorbed the image before her.\n\nThere he was--Kristopher Norris!\n\nThe suit jacket draped carelessly over Lise was a dead giveaway.\n\nEvery piece of clothing Kristopher owned had been meticulously tailored by a master craftsman abroad, a detail Carrie knew all too well.\n\nHer grip on her phone tightened, her knuckles blanching to a stark white, as if her very soul were being squeezed by an invisible hand, the pain sharp and acid-like in its intensity.\n\nIn her most desperate moment, Kristopher had coldly disconnected their call, choosing instead to be at Lise's side.\n\nWhat was the worth of their two-year marriage?\n\nThe tears she had been holding back now overwhelmed her, streaming down her face.\n\nEven as she tilted her head back in a futile attempt to stem the flow, the tears continued to escape.\n\nLise had always been Kristopher's first love, a fact whispered and gossiped about among their circles. The Norris family had never approved of Lise, seeing her ordinary background as unfitting.\n\nForced apart by family pressures, it had been Lise who ended things, but the past, it seemed, was not easily left behind.\n\nKristopher had diligently pursued the leadership of the Norris family, harboring dreams of finally being with Lise.\n\nYet, when he reached his goal, he discovered that Lise had already chosen another.\n\nIn defiance of his family's expectations and perhaps out of bitterness, Kristopher turned to Carrie, a woman equally devoid of wealth or status, to become Mrs. Norris, thereby blocking any matchmaking attempts by his relatives.\n\nAt that time, Carrie faced immense pressure from her father, Tristan Campbell, who was pushing her towards a marriage with a playboy, the son of a business associate, to cover her grandmother's steep medical expenses.\n\nBoth Kristopher and Carrie, driven by their personal motives, consented to a marriage of convenience.\n\nOriginally set for just one year, their contractual marriage stretched beyond its term, sustained by a shared understanding between them.\n\nOver time, Carrie began to believe in the authenticity of their union, never suspecting that it was merely an extension of her hopes.\n\nJust moments ago, a fire had nearly claimed Carrie's life. In that critical moment, she reached out to Kristopher, only to be twice rebuffed as he spent his time with Lise.\n\nThis harsh reality shattered Carrie's illusions, revealing that her perceived transition from pretense to genuine relationship was nothing but a facade maintained by her own desires.\n\nCarrie wasn't even a temporary substitute in Kristopher's life but merely a pawn used to spite his family.\n\nAfter a poignant pause, tears welled up in Carrie's eyes, unstoppable and poignant.\n\nIt might be time for her to release herself from the shackles of her own hopeful delusions--to stop deceiving herself.\n\nChapter 2 Trending Topics\nThe overwhelming number of injuries from the fire was staggering, straining the already frantic doctors and nurses as they tried to provide aid.\n\nCarrie had been merely grazed by a splintered clothes rack, which left a deep, jagged wound on her calf. In comparison to the chaos around her, her wounds seemed almost negligible.\n\nShe managed to get basic care--a brisk cleaning and a quick wrap of bandages--at a local hospital before catching a cab back to her house.\n\nBayview Villa, a grand property under Kristopher's name, was technically their matrimonial residence.\n\nLiving alone had become the norm for Carrie, as Kristopher was hardly ever around. She had bid farewell to the housekeeper, discovering that her life could be quite adequately maintained with just takeout, deliveries, and the occasional visit from a part-time cleaner.\n\nNow, she found herself the sole occupant of the sprawling living room, sinking into the sofa, her gaze drifting across the empty space.\n\nThe stark, monochrome decor did nothing to imbue warmth into the atmosphere.\n\nA chilling realization crept up on her: this vast, elegant space felt more like a colossal tomb, a silent grave for her lost years of youth and a love that had quietly slipped away.\n\nIn this cold, echoing house, would anyone even notice if her breath ceased one day?\n\nCarrie exhaled a weary sigh, her frame heavy as she leaned against the cold wall for support, struggling up the stairs to her bedroom on the second floor.\n\nEach step was a battle, sending stabbing pains shooting through her from the surface of her skin down to her aching bones.\n\nThe house, stark and hollow, echoed even the smallest sounds, magnifying her sense of isolation.\n\nIt was today, amidst this profound silence, that Carrie truly grasped the all-encompassing nature of her loneliness--it was almost tangible, enveloping her senses with its texture and mournful whispers, tightening around her heart like a vice, producing a dull, relentless ache.\n\nUpon reaching the sanctuary of her bedroom, she collapsed onto the bed, the very embodiment of exhaustion, feeling it both physically and spiritually.\n\nJust as she surrendered to this weariness, the sharp ring of the phone pierced the silence.\n\n\"You reached out to me earlier. What do you need?\" Kristopher's voice cut through the line, cold and distant as ever.\n\nCarrie was caught off guard by his unexpected call. Words failed her as she parted her lips to respond, but before she could collect her thoughts, a soft, feminine voice floated through from the other end. \"Kristopher, will you join me to...\"\n\nA surge of emotions tightened Carrie's grip on the phone, her heart thumping louder with each second. Overwhelmed and unable to contain her rising panic, she demanded, \"Who's there with you?\"\n\nKristopher gave no answer, merely stating in a flat, disinterested voice, \"If there's something you need, let's catch up when I'm back. I have pressing engagements right now, so I must disconnect.\"\n\nHe promptly ended the call, cutting off any chance for Carrie to reply.\n\nAs the harsh beep of the disconnected line filled her ears, Carrie's lips twisted into a rueful grin. How utterly foolish she felt! Deep down, she knew his response all too well, yet she had clung to the hope of hearing his voice confirm it.\n\nWith a sense of self-inflicted irony, Carrie activated her tablet and scrolled through the day's hot topics.\n\nOne headline caught her eye: \"A female star shielded from harassment at a dinner by her formidable partner.\" A wry smile twisted her lips.\n\nCarrie knew all too well what it was like to face harassment at those kinds of dinners.\n\nShe vividly remembered her first major audition after her entering the showbiz; her agent had escorted her to a dinner with the influential director and producer of the drama series \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nAs a novice in the dizzying world of showbiz, Carrie had felt incredibly vulnerable, uncertain of how to navigate the murky waters of such gatherings.\n\nThe producer had eyed her shamelessly, sneering as he asked, \"Is this the new talent you're introducing? She appears presentable, but I'm curious to see how she fares with a drink. Here's the deal, if you can gulp down this bottle in one go, I'll secure you an audition for the lead role.\"\n\nCarrie was inclined to decline, but under the relentless pressure from her agent, she found herself compelled to consume the entire bottle.\n\nAs the evening wore on, she was hurriedly taken to the hospital suffering from a severe stomach ailment.\n\nHer agent, fretful about the prospect of the role slipping away to another, quickly settled the hospital charges and departed.\n\nAt that time, Carrie found herself isolated in a hospital bed for several long days.\n\nYet, even before Carrie could be released from the hospital, the media was abuzz with the announcement that Lise had secured the lead role in \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nSubsequently, her agent rebuked Carrie for her lack of ambition, complaining, \"You are more appealing than Lise, so why can't you show more drive? She cozied up to Mr. Norris and hardly had to make an effort. She's surrounded by people eager to cater to her every need. I've heard that Mr. Norris personally orchestrated her landing the lead role in this production!\"\n\nWhen the show premiered, Lise was catapulted into stardom, swiftly ascending to the elite echelons of the acting world.\n\nFrom that moment forward, Carrie let her acting aspirations wane and chose instead to devote herself entirely to supporting her husband, Kristopher.\n\nAfter all, no matter her efforts, she could never get the same career opportunities that Lise seemed to receive effortlessly with Kristopher's offhand remarks.\n\nAt that time, Carrie had believed she was filling the role that was meant to be Lise's as Mrs. Norris, which meant she owed Lise.\n\nBy giving up the career opportunities to Lise, Carrie thought they would settle their unspoken debt.\n\nHowever, Carrie hadn't foreseen that Lise would claim both the coveted career and Kristopher's affections.\n\nAs Lise's professional and love life blossomed, Carrie came to the painful realization that she had been overly consumed with her romantic pursuits, at the expense of her career, and now, she found herself bereft of both love and professional fulfillment.\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Carrie viewed her past two years as tragically misguided.\n\nGiven another opportunity, she resolved she wouldn't be so unguarded, letting her heart recklessly fall captive to Kristopher's charm.\n\n\"Ms. Spencer, the new copyright contract is prepared. Please review it for any discrepancies.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed with the alert, snapping Carrie out of her reverie. She gazed at the PDF file attached in the message, her mind briefly overwhelmed.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Katrina Spencer, Carrie had once made a name for herself as a budding screenwriter, selling numerous scripts in her early days.\n\nDuring her early career as Katrina, Carrie often sold her work for a pittance, compelled by her urgent need for immediate cash.\n\nOver the years, these scripts transformed into blockbuster films and hit series, catapulting Katrina's reputation to new heights.\n\nBy this time, Carrie had married Kristopher and was no longer plagued by the financial woes that had once driven her to desperation--her grandmother's hefty medical bills were a thing of the past. With her financial crises resolved, Carrie's life had pivoted to domestic responsibilities, striving to be an exemplary wife to Kristopher. Amidst these changes, her pseudonym, Katrina Spencer, gradually receded into the background.\n\nHowever, her past as Katrina wasn't ready to be shelved just yet. Recently, an interested buyer had come forward, ready to pay a handsome sum for one of her old scripts.\n\nCarrie, however, was hesitant to sell. She raised several concerns about the contract presented to her, and to her astonishment, the buyer was genuine enough to revise it accordingly.\n\nHolding the revised contract in her hands, Carrie inhaled deeply, her resolve hardening. She seemed to have reached a crucial decision.\n\nHer fingers danced over her phone's keyboard with swift precision, typing out a firm command. \"Create a divorce agreement following my terms and ensure it reaches Kristopher Norris at the Norris Group.\"\n\nWithout pausing for a response, she placed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step echoing a blend of determination and newfound independence.\n\nChapter 3 Exchange Of Conveniences\nThirty minutes had passed, Carrie finally heaved herself up from the bathtub, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. As she lifted her gaze, her own image in the mirror halted her movements--her skin appeared as smooth and impeccable as fine porcelain, glowing with an unblemished radiance.\n\nHer eyes, deep pools of allure, sparkled with an enchanting, soft warmth, inviting anyone who dared meet her gaze.\n\nDespite edging into her late twenties at twenty-five, she reveled in the fact that time had yet to etch its marks upon her flawless complexion.\n\nSurely, a woman with such a visage had no place for self-pity.\n\nAbsorbed in her contemplation, Carrie carelessly extended her right leg onto the cold floor, forgetting it was the very limb she had injured. Wrapped excessively in cling film to shield it from moisture, the tight encasement had stifled her circulation, rendering her leg eerily numb. As her foot touched down, it betrayed her, slipping forward unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Carrie gasped, her arms flailing in a frantic ballet, searching for a lifeline in the void.\n\nJust as she teetered on the brink of a painful rendezvous with the floor, the bathroom door burst open.\n\nKristopher stood at the entrance, his suit immaculately tailored, creating a striking figure. As their eyes locked, he paused, visibly taken aback, then quickly closed the distance with brisk strides.\n\nCarrie's breath caught as Kristopher swept her up in a graceful bridal style, an unexpected tightness wrapping around her waist. Caught off guard by his sudden appearance, Carrie realized with a jolt that she was completely bare. A flush of embarrassment washed over her as she instinctively clutched her hands over her chest.\n\nThis was their first moment of such intimacy since their wedding, and the discomfort made her toes curl inward, her skin blushing a delicate shade of pink.\n\nKristopher looked down at her with a mischievous grin. \"Let's be honest, there's not much to see,\" he teased gently.\n\nFeeling both mortified and slightly irritated, Carrie snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Norris, after all you've seen, I suppose nothing can impress you anymore.\"\n\nShe carried her C-cup curves with understated charm, a touch of sensuality that outshone Lise's painfully flat, almost awkwardly rigid build.\n\nYet Carrie knew well that without love, even the most perfect physique paled in comparison to the charm of one dearly cherished.\n\nNonchalantly, Kristopher reached for a bathrobe hanging behind the door and draped it over her. His frown deepened at her comment. \"What are you talking about, Carrie?\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike him, and his expression grew even more impatient. \"Tell me, did you send those divorce papers in the dead of night just to lure me back here--to catch you completely bare?\" His tone was a mix of disbelief and annoyance. \"I told you I was swamped with work. Was this dramatic display really necessary?\"\n\nCarrie's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the tension between them. He was always so quick to lose patience with her.\n\nShe wasn't the type to throw around words like divorce or breakups lightly. In fact, this was the first time she'd ever mentioned divorce in their two-year marriage, yet he seemed indifferent to her turmoil. He simply dismissed her concerns as if she were overreacting about trivial matters.\n\nDespite the throbbing pain in her leg, Carrie mustered her strength and said, \"Put me down.\"\n\nKristopher, however, paid no heed, his eyes scanning her leg swathed in bandages. His brow furrowed slightly. \"What happened to your leg? Is this some elaborate ploy to lure me back?\"\n\nAt his words, a bitter laugh escaped Carrie.\n\nIt seemed he viewed her as merely seeking attention, and in failing to capture it, she had likely concocted a story to draw him back, allowing her to dramatize her plight in his presence.\n\nWith a blank face, she replied untruthfully, \"It's a beauty treatment that shouldn't get wet.\"\n\n\"Why did you suddenly decide to undergo such a treatment?\" Kristopher inquired, his tone casual as he carried her outside, not pressing the issue further.\n\nHis frame was large, and through his thin shirt, she could distinctly feel the warmth of his body and the defined shape of his chest muscles.\n\nThe closeness created an uncomfortable tension for Carrie, who had resolved to end things once and for all.\n\nHer voice climbed involuntarily, sharper this time. \"Oh, since when have you been concerned with such minor things, Mr. Norris?\"\n\nFor the first time, Kristopher witnessed her using biting sarcasm; it struck him as peculiarly amusing. With a calm demeanor, he responded, \"You're my wife, it's only natural I'd be concerned about your well-being.\"\n\n\"Really?\" There was a somber note in Carrie's voice now. \"It seems like you've never really regarded me as your wife. I'm scared that if I were to die, you wouldn't even know until much later.\"\n\nAfter all, at that very moment, Kristopher had been distracted, lost in moments with his first love, too consumed to lend an ear to her desperate pleas.\n\nCaught off guard by her accusation, Kristopher's eyes widened with surprise before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. \"Carrie, what's brought on this sudden outburst of anger? Just because I was tied up this afternoon and missed your call? Perhaps I've been too indulgent with you lately, and it's made you a bit too presumptuous?\"\n\nCarrie froze, startled. Was he accusing her of being too presumptuous?\n\nShe realized their marriage had always been lopsided. In his eyes, she was nothing more than a transactional partner, a woman who had bartered her freedom for financial security.\n\nTheir union was meant to be a mere exchange of conveniences, yet she had, quite foolishly, fallen deeply in love with him.\n\nIn the tricky terrain of romance, the one who fell first invariably found themselves at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nKristopher's dismissive reaction left Carrie reeling, her emotions dismissed as trifles, a tight knot of suffocation rising in her chest.\n\n\"I said to put me down this instant!\" Carrie exclaimed, jerking her head to the side, her voice laced with a sharp edge of impatience.\n\nKristopher remained mute, effortlessly carrying her towards the bed before suddenly releasing his hold.\n\nCarrie felt a jolt as the support vanished, her heart skipping a beat as she instinctively grasped for him.\n\nTheir bodies collided on the bed, her bathrobe teetering on the brink of decency, threatening to unravel with any minor shift.\n\nPropped on one elbow, Kristopher gazed down at her, his lips curled into a sly, teasing grin. \"You wanted to be let go, didn't you? So why cling to me now?\"\n\nHis eyes, deep and sparkling like a midnight lake speckled with stars, captivated her.\n\nIn those celestial depths, Carrie caught a glimpse of her own reflection.\n\nAt times like this, she was misled into believing he harbored a deep affection.\n\nSadly, his heart was a fortress reserved for Lise, and all Carrie had left were empty fantasies.\n\n\"Boring!\" she exclaimed, her voice devoid of any enthusiasm as she attempted to rise, her hand inadvertently brushing against something unexpected.\n\nThe following moment brought a noticeable shift in his cock pressing against her stomach.\n\n\"Don't move, or I can't promise what might happen next,\" he warned in a deep, gravelly voice.\n\nWith a frown, Carrie internally cursed upon hearing the statement.\n\nIt was an undeniable fact. Primal instincts steered the actions of men. Absence of affection didn't quell their basic desires.\n\nYet, she dared not agitate Kristopher. Angling her face away, her body remained rigid, frozen in place.\n\nCarrie, feeling irked, shot back. \"Didn't you say there's nothing here to see? What's with the reaction now, Mr. Norris? Are you really that easy to impress?\"\n\nNo sooner had her words flown than she grasped the potential repercussions of her sharp tongue.\n\nA wave of regret surged through Carrie, but instead of anger, Kristopher responded with a chuckle, \"You are my wife, after all. Since that's something I can't alter, I might as well embrace it. Besides, it's been years since we became husband and wife--it would be a shame to neglect you completely.\"\n\nChapter 4 Are You Out Of Your Mind?\nKristopher slipped his hand beneath the folds of her bathrobe, his touch tracing the curve of Carrie's skin, as smooth and delicate as silk. He encircled her slender waist, drawing her closer with a gentle yet firm grip.\n\nHer face, a captivating canvas of defiance and visible irritation, ignited in him an uncontrollable urge to claim victory over her resistance.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy, yet he remained composed, slowly removing his tailored suit.\n\nThe fabric of his suit brushed lightly against Carrie's cheek, releasing a mix of scents: a familiar woody aroma intertwined with an unexpected zesty twist of lemon. It was unmistakably Jo Malone's Blue Agava and Cacao--Lise's signature scent.\n\nA surge of nausea overwhelmed Carrie at the realization.\n\nAs Kristopher's eyes, now shaded with a stormy intensity, drew nearer to hers, the proximity conjured unwelcome visions of him with Lise. Her stomach churned violently, and with a sudden movement, she pushed him away, propping herself up with a jolt and a dry retch.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer stomach had been empty all day, leaving her with nothing to bring up.\n\nThe desire in Kristopher's gaze flickered out, replaced by a cold, detached expression as he withdrew slightly.\n\nObserving the genuine distress and the reddening of Carrie's eyes, Kristopher perceived her reaction for outright disgust at their closeness.\n\nHe paused, fingers adjusting his shirt cuffs, his voice cold as he confronted her. \"Carrie, is this reaction reserved only for me, or is it how you respond to all men?\"\n\nThe air in the room turned frosty, thick with tension.\n\nCarrie swallowed the sharp sting in her throat, her eyes widening in shock as she stared up at him.\n\nEver since their marriage, she had cut ties with nearly all her male friends, yet here was Kristopher, casually tossing out comments sharp enough to cut glass.\n\nThe years of love she had poured into their relationship now seemed utterly futile.\n\nHeat crept up her neck, coloring her cheeks a bright scarlet as indignation took hold. Without thinking, her hand flew up and delivered a stinging slap across Kristopher's face.\n\nAll her suppressed grievances from the day ignited in that swift motion.\n\nHer bathrobe, loosened in the heat of the moment, slipped from her shoulders. Ignoring the flush of exposure, she swiftly gathered the fabric and draped it around herself, her movements quick and firm.\n\nThe impact of her slap had left a light, crimson mark on Kristopher's cheek, marking him with her outrage.\n\nHis eyes, wide with disbelief, met hers. \"Carrie, are you out of your mind?\"\n\nOut of her mind? Yes, she was clearly insane to ever fall for him in the first place.\n\nCarrie fumed silently, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nSuddenly, the sharp buzz of the phone on the table cut through the mounting tension, its vibration bringing a brief respite from their standoff.\n\nKristopher cast a fleeting glance at the message, shut off the phone with a snap, and strode towards the door, his back rigid with tension.\n\nHer voice, firm and unwavering, chased after him. \"We're getting a divorce! Make sure you sign those papers before you walk out that door!\"\n\nKristopher paused briefly and said sharply, \"I have something to do now. When I return, do whatever pleases you.\" With that, he forcefully shut the door.\n\nCarrie's eyes followed his unwavering exit, feeling an oppressive weight compressing her chest once again.\n\nShe disregarded the sharp sting in her leg and hobbled determinedly toward her tablet. Fingers trembling, she hastily navigated to Lise's Twitter page.\n\nLise had just uploaded a new tweet.\n\nThe photo showed her lying down with a fever patch adhered to her forehead, still enveloped in Kristopher's familiar jacket.\n\nThe caption read, \"Being sick makes me extra clingy. Wishing I had someone here. Stay cozy and take care, everyone!\"\n\nThe simultaneous timing of these two events made it almost impossible for Carrie not to suspect that Kristopher had dashed off to tend to Lise.\n\nCarrie's instincts loudly proclaimed that this was no accident; Lise had deliberately sought to tug at Kristopher's heartstrings. It appeared her tactics were effective.\n\nNot even Carrie's stark threat of divorce could overshadow Lise's theatrical display of vulnerability.\n\nSeething with fury, Carrie quaked like a leaf swept into a storm.\n\nShe steeled herself against the heartache, forcefully ripping the plastic wrap from her aching leg.\n\nAfter her lengthy soak, the bath's lingering moisture had infiltrated her skin, inflaming the wound until it was a vivid, angry red and painfully swollen.\n\nShe, too, could be clingy. Even in the harshest times back in the county, she had shown vulnerability, breaking down into soft sobs within the comforting arms of her grandmother, especially that one time she got burned by the scalding kettle.\n\nBut such vulnerability had its time and place, and it wasn't now.\n\nThe stark reality of Kristopher's exit forced Carrie to confront her need for self-reliance.\n\nBiting down hard on her lip, Carrie cleaned the throbbing wound with a practiced hand before securely wrapping it anew.\n\nShe rose with a newfound resolve and yanked a black suitcase from the far end of her expansive walk-in closet--it held all the belongings she'd brought into this house as a hopeful bride.\n\nShe grabbed a fresh set of clothes to slip into and left a bank card neatly on the bedside table.\n\nShe had transferred every penny she'd earned over the past year onto that card, effectively settling her financial entanglements with Kristopher over the last two years and cutting him out of her life for good.\n\nDragging the heavy suitcase behind her, she limped painfully out of the opulent villa.\n\nAs she passed through the gate, she wrapped her baseball jacket more tightly around her slight figure, her silhouette hauntingly solitary in the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe night air of early spring was bitingly cold, devoid of any trace of warmth, a chill that seemed almost faint compared to the ice forming in Carrie's shattered heart.\n\nShe had arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a heart full of dreams, and now she was leaving, dreams crumbled, utterly alone.\n\nA bitter laugh slipped through her lips. If only she hadn't fallen so hard for him, if only she'd proposed an amicable separation at the end of their agreed year, maybe she wouldn't be wandering now, a lost soul in the shadow of her former self.\n\nLise didn't have to lift a finger, and Carrie had already fallen, utterly broken and beyond redemption.\n\nChapter 5 A Gathering\nMeanwhile, in the Oasis Club, renowned as the priciest spot in Orkset, the air within the VIP room crackled with excitement. Under the spell of bright lights and thumping music, a diverse group of men and women lounged together, basking in the exclusivity of the setting.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, revealing Kristopher in the doorway.\n\nThe karaoke session halted abruptly as the crowd turned to greet him in unison, voices mingling. \"Kristopher...\"\n\nBefore they could utter another word, a woman cloaked from head to toe stepped out from behind him.\n\nLise, with a fluid motion, removed her mask and slid her arm through Kristopher's. She addressed the room with a poised charm. \"My assistant took a sudden leave, and I found myself without company. Not keen on spending the evening alone, I invited Kristopher to join me. I trust that's alright?\"\n\nLise's beauty was without question. Her face was a delicate composition of cherry lips and a sculpted nose, framed by eyes that shimmered with a vulnerable allure, commanding a protective fervor from those around her--her presence, ethereal.\n\nIn contrast, Carrie's features were more pronounced, her beauty vivid and striking. Lise, by comparison, carried a softer, more understated elegance.\n\nYet, as it often goes, matters of the heart followed no simple paths.\n\nWhile Kristopher and Carrie were married, it was in name only; Kristopher seemed detached and seldom included her in private social events.\n\nThe group didn't have much of a relationship with Carrie, leading them to feel no obligation to defend her.\n\nUpon hearing Lise's comment, a moment of discomfort rippled through the air. Nonetheless, they quickly recovered, offering a congenial smile as they said, \"We're all friends here; let's not bother with formalities.\"\n\nLise offered a subtle, knowing smile, as she gracefully accompanied Kristopher into the bustling room.\n\nThe event that evening had been meticulously planned to express appreciation for Kristopher's contributions.\n\nAs they stepped into the room, the crowd parted like the sea, making way for them to proceed to the seats of honor.\n\nThe group's leader handed Kristopher a glass of wine with a flourish, proclaiming with a broad grin, \"We truly owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Norris! Your exceptional talents are the talk of the town, and witnessing them firsthand today only confirms it. Without your expertise, securing this contract would have been a fantasy!\"\n\nTheir gathering marked the launch of a novel shopping platform, one that had been in negotiation with numerous local brands in Orkset. But the scenario changed dramatically when the tech giant JoyBuy dramatically entered the scene, stirring up the competitive landscape.\n\nCompeting with JoyBuy was akin to the classic David versus Goliath tale--hopelessly daunting. In a surge of desperation, they turned to Kristopher, reaching out through a network of connections for his renowned strategic prowess.\n\nWith his characteristic swiftness, Kristopher hatched an ingenious plan and swiftly secured the deal, snatching it from the clutches of JoyBuy right before the business association could ink their agreement--a masterful coup that reverberated success.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround only intensified the already deep respect everyone held for Kristopher.\n\nAlbin Murray, beaming with pride, couldn't help but boast, \"Ah, just look at the caliber of his friends! They thought they could steal deals right under our noses, obviously underestimating Kristopher's clout!\"\n\nAlbin, born into the wealthy Murray family, counted himself among Kristopher's closest friends. He was renowned for his sprawling social web--a network through which the desperate plea for help was channeled to Kristopher.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristopher himself, the focus of all their discussions, reclined nonchalantly on the couch, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe was well-versed in the art of receiving compliments; thus, his expression stayed calm and detached.\n\nThe ambient light sculpted his angular features, casting dramatic shadows that emphasized his high nose bridge and sharply cut jawline, as though he were a living masterpiece.\n\nHis natural grace and detachment eclipsed any terrestrial magnificence.\n\nFollowing a sequence of celebratory toasts, when it became apparent that Kristopher merely touched his glass without truly drinking, the rest of the company toned down their conversation, allowing him a moment of repose with his eyes gently shut.\n\nLise, slightly feverish, opted not to indulge in the spirits, choosing instead to sit in serene silence next to Kristopher, her eyes lingering on him with a look of deep, unmistakable adoration.\n\nAlbin, captivated by the seemingly perfect pair, pondered the whims of destiny. He discreetly captured their image with his smartphone and nonchalantly shared it across his social networks.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the liquor dwindled, the room's door swung open anew.\n\nKristopher's personal assistant, Oliver Brooks, made his entrance, acknowledging the gathering with a courteous nod that bordered on respect but avoided groveling, swiftly positioning himself in front of Kristopher.\n\nSilence hung in the air, yet Lise, unable to contain her curiosity, leaned in and whispered, \"What's going on?\"\n\nOliver, maintaining his focus on Kristopher, chose not to respond directly to her.\n\nA flush of embarrassment tinted Lise's cheeks as she turned towards Kristopher, hesitatingly inquiring, \"Should I leave?\"\n\nKristopher adjusted his posture, his voice low and calm as he instructed, \"Go ahead, speak.\"\n\nA shiver of apprehension coursed through Oliver as he tentatively began, \"Mr. Norris, Mrs. Norris has departed from Bayview Villa, and...\"\n\n&9&\n0:00 / 4:50",

        "primary_text": "\"He finally remembered the woman waiting for him at home, only to face her divorce papers. Confident she'd regret it, he signed. But post-divorce, she blossomed, turning heads everywhere. Defeated, he begged to win her back!\n=====\nIn the bustling, weathered heart of Orkset, flames erupted violently within an ancient apartment building. Propelled by gusts of wind, the fire devoured the structure, belching dense smoke and bright, searing tongues of flame.\n\n\"Saved! They've been saved.\" The words echoed amidst the chaos.\n\nFirefighters emerged from the smoldering inferno, carrying Carrie Campbell to safety at the roadside.\n\nHer features, usually refined and expressive, were now smeared with soot; her sparkling eyes dimmed to a vacant gaze, hollow and lost.\n\nAs reality seeped back into her consciousness, Carrie felt a rush of gratitude overpower her usual composure. Her voice, hoarse and weak, conveyed a profound \"thank you\" to her rescuers. Shaking, she fumbled for her phone, her fingertips quivering as they found the familiar number.\n\n\"Hello, the person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe automated message played after a few rings, leaving her with a lump in her throat, her unvoiced frustrations and sorrow welling up inside her.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a deafening roar, the explosion abruptly silenced the cold, mechanical voice echoing through the line. Carrie's head snapped upwards, shock painted on her face as she witnessed the apartment she had just exited erupt into flames.\n\nChunks of debris were hurled into the air by the force of the blast, scattering across the sky.\n\nPanic engulfed the crowd as survivors, freshly rescued, screamed in terror. They huddled together, seeking solace in each other's arms, their cries piercing the tumultuous scene. In stark contrast, Carrie lay alone on a stretcher, her isolation magnified amidst the chaos.\n\n\"Kristopher...\" Fighting the dread creeping up her spine, Carrie pressed her lips together tightly and dialed her husband's number again, her resolve unwavering.\n\nYet, the call disconnected after a few short rings, leaving her with a haunting silence.\n\nJust then, a Twitter notification flickered on her phone screen.\n\nThe gossip feed was alive with the latest gossip: #LiseNash #MysteriouBoyfriend.\n\nAccording to the tweet, a producer from a well-known variety show had invited the renowned star Lise Nash to a dinner, which had quickly soured when she declined to partake in a toast.\n\nThis act of defiance had sparked a confrontation, only to be interrupted by Lise's domineering boyfriend. He stormed into the private dining room, dismissing the producer with a dismissive wave and escorting Lise away.\n\nThe tweet described the scene vividly, painting a picture of a powerful man defending his beloved partner.\n\nYet, perhaps due to his prominence, only the back of the man was visible in the accompanying photos, preserving his anonymity. Meanwhile, Lise, donning an oversized suit jacket, beamed a smile, reaching out to clasp his hand as they departed together.\n\nCarrie's eyes were glued to the screen, her stare intense and unblinking as she absorbed the image before her.\n\nThere he was--Kristopher Norris!\n\nThe suit jacket draped carelessly over Lise was a dead giveaway.\n\nEvery piece of clothing Kristopher owned had been meticulously tailored by a master craftsman abroad, a detail Carrie knew all too well.\n\nHer grip on her phone tightened, her knuckles blanching to a stark white, as if her very soul were being squeezed by an invisible hand, the pain sharp and acid-like in its intensity.\n\nIn her most desperate moment, Kristopher had coldly disconnected their call, choosing instead to be at Lise's side.\n\nWhat was the worth of their two-year marriage?\n\nThe tears she had been holding back now overwhelmed her, streaming down her face.\n\nEven as she tilted her head back in a futile attempt to stem the flow, the tears continued to escape.\n\nLise had always been Kristopher's first love, a fact whispered and gossiped about among their circles. The Norris family had never approved of Lise, seeing her ordinary background as unfitting.\n\nForced apart by family pressures, it had been Lise who ended things, but the past, it seemed, was not easily left behind.\n\nKristopher had diligently pursued the leadership of the Norris family, harboring dreams of finally being with Lise.\n\nYet, when he reached his goal, he discovered that Lise had already chosen another.\n\nIn defiance of his family's expectations and perhaps out of bitterness, Kristopher turned to Carrie, a woman equally devoid of wealth or status, to become Mrs. Norris, thereby blocking any matchmaking attempts by his relatives.\n\nAt that time, Carrie faced immense pressure from her father, Tristan Campbell, who was pushing her towards a marriage with a playboy, the son of a business associate, to cover her grandmother's steep medical expenses.\n\nBoth Kristopher and Carrie, driven by their personal motives, consented to a marriage of convenience.\n\nOriginally set for just one year, their contractual marriage stretched beyond its term, sustained by a shared understanding between them.\n\nOver time, Carrie began to believe in the authenticity of their union, never suspecting that it was merely an extension of her hopes.\n\nJust moments ago, a fire had nearly claimed Carrie's life. In that critical moment, she reached out to Kristopher, only to be twice rebuffed as he spent his time with Lise.\n\nThis harsh reality shattered Carrie's illusions, revealing that her perceived transition from pretense to genuine relationship was nothing but a facade maintained by her own desires.\n\nCarrie wasn't even a temporary substitute in Kristopher's life but merely a pawn used to spite his family.\n\nAfter a poignant pause, tears welled up in Carrie's eyes, unstoppable and poignant.\n\nIt might be time for her to release herself from the shackles of her own hopeful delusions--to stop deceiving herself.\n\nChapter 2 Trending Topics\nThe overwhelming number of injuries from the fire was staggering, straining the already frantic doctors and nurses as they tried to provide aid.\n\nCarrie had been merely grazed by a splintered clothes rack, which left a deep, jagged wound on her calf. In comparison to the chaos around her, her wounds seemed almost negligible.\n\nShe managed to get basic care--a brisk cleaning and a quick wrap of bandages--at a local hospital before catching a cab back to her house.\n\nBayview Villa, a grand property under Kristopher's name, was technically their matrimonial residence.\n\nLiving alone had become the norm for Carrie, as Kristopher was hardly ever around. She had bid farewell to the housekeeper, discovering that her life could be quite adequately maintained with just takeout, deliveries, and the occasional visit from a part-time cleaner.\n\nNow, she found herself the sole occupant of the sprawling living room, sinking into the sofa, her gaze drifting across the empty space.\n\nThe stark, monochrome decor did nothing to imbue warmth into the atmosphere.\n\nA chilling realization crept up on her: this vast, elegant space felt more like a colossal tomb, a silent grave for her lost years of youth and a love that had quietly slipped away.\n\nIn this cold, echoing house, would anyone even notice if her breath ceased one day?\n\nCarrie exhaled a weary sigh, her frame heavy as she leaned against the cold wall for support, struggling up the stairs to her bedroom on the second floor.\n\nEach step was a battle, sending stabbing pains shooting through her from the surface of her skin down to her aching bones.\n\nThe house, stark and hollow, echoed even the smallest sounds, magnifying her sense of isolation.\n\nIt was today, amidst this profound silence, that Carrie truly grasped the all-encompassing nature of her loneliness--it was almost tangible, enveloping her senses with its texture and mournful whispers, tightening around her heart like a vice, producing a dull, relentless ache.\n\nUpon reaching the sanctuary of her bedroom, she collapsed onto the bed, the very embodiment of exhaustion, feeling it both physically and spiritually.\n\nJust as she surrendered to this weariness, the sharp ring of the phone pierced the silence.\n\n\"You reached out to me earlier. What do you need?\" Kristopher's voice cut through the line, cold and distant as ever.\n\nCarrie was caught off guard by his unexpected call. Words failed her as she parted her lips to respond, but before she could collect her thoughts, a soft, feminine voice floated through from the other end. \"Kristopher, will you join me to...\"\n\nA surge of emotions tightened Carrie's grip on the phone, her heart thumping louder with each second. Overwhelmed and unable to contain her rising panic, she demanded, \"Who's there with you?\"\n\nKristopher gave no answer, merely stating in a flat, disinterested voice, \"If there's something you need, let's catch up when I'm back. I have pressing engagements right now, so I must disconnect.\"\n\nHe promptly ended the call, cutting off any chance for Carrie to reply.\n\nAs the harsh beep of the disconnected line filled her ears, Carrie's lips twisted into a rueful grin. How utterly foolish she felt! Deep down, she knew his response all too well, yet she had clung to the hope of hearing his voice confirm it.\n\nWith a sense of self-inflicted irony, Carrie activated her tablet and scrolled through the day's hot topics.\n\nOne headline caught her eye: \"A female star shielded from harassment at a dinner by her formidable partner.\" A wry smile twisted her lips.\n\nCarrie knew all too well what it was like to face harassment at those kinds of dinners.\n\nShe vividly remembered her first major audition after her entering the showbiz; her agent had escorted her to a dinner with the influential director and producer of the drama series \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nAs a novice in the dizzying world of showbiz, Carrie had felt incredibly vulnerable, uncertain of how to navigate the murky waters of such gatherings.\n\nThe producer had eyed her shamelessly, sneering as he asked, \"Is this the new talent you're introducing? She appears presentable, but I'm curious to see how she fares with a drink. Here's the deal, if you can gulp down this bottle in one go, I'll secure you an audition for the lead role.\"\n\nCarrie was inclined to decline, but under the relentless pressure from her agent, she found herself compelled to consume the entire bottle.\n\nAs the evening wore on, she was hurriedly taken to the hospital suffering from a severe stomach ailment.\n\nHer agent, fretful about the prospect of the role slipping away to another, quickly settled the hospital charges and departed.\n\nAt that time, Carrie found herself isolated in a hospital bed for several long days.\n\nYet, even before Carrie could be released from the hospital, the media was abuzz with the announcement that Lise had secured the lead role in \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nSubsequently, her agent rebuked Carrie for her lack of ambition, complaining, \"You are more appealing than Lise, so why can't you show more drive? She cozied up to Mr. Norris and hardly had to make an effort. She's surrounded by people eager to cater to her every need. I've heard that Mr. Norris personally orchestrated her landing the lead role in this production!\"\n\nWhen the show premiered, Lise was catapulted into stardom, swiftly ascending to the elite echelons of the acting world.\n\nFrom that moment forward, Carrie let her acting aspirations wane and chose instead to devote herself entirely to supporting her husband, Kristopher.\n\nAfter all, no matter her efforts, she could never get the same career opportunities that Lise seemed to receive effortlessly with Kristopher's offhand remarks.\n\nAt that time, Carrie had believed she was filling the role that was meant to be Lise's as Mrs. Norris, which meant she owed Lise.\n\nBy giving up the career opportunities to Lise, Carrie thought they would settle their unspoken debt.\n\nHowever, Carrie hadn't foreseen that Lise would claim both the coveted career and Kristopher's affections.\n\nAs Lise's professional and love life blossomed, Carrie came to the painful realization that she had been overly consumed with her romantic pursuits, at the expense of her career, and now, she found herself bereft of both love and professional fulfillment.\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Carrie viewed her past two years as tragically misguided.\n\nGiven another opportunity, she resolved she wouldn't be so unguarded, letting her heart recklessly fall captive to Kristopher's charm.\n\n\"Ms. Spencer, the new copyright contract is prepared. Please review it for any discrepancies.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed with the alert, snapping Carrie out of her reverie. She gazed at the PDF file attached in the message, her mind briefly overwhelmed.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Katrina Spencer, Carrie had once made a name for herself as a budding screenwriter, selling numerous scripts in her early days.\n\nDuring her early career as Katrina, Carrie often sold her work for a pittance, compelled by her urgent need for immediate cash.\n\nOver the years, these scripts transformed into blockbuster films and hit series, catapulting Katrina's reputation to new heights.\n\nBy this time, Carrie had married Kristopher and was no longer plagued by the financial woes that had once driven her to desperation--her grandmother's hefty medical bills were a thing of the past. With her financial crises resolved, Carrie's life had pivoted to domestic responsibilities, striving to be an exemplary wife to Kristopher. Amidst these changes, her pseudonym, Katrina Spencer, gradually receded into the background.\n\nHowever, her past as Katrina wasn't ready to be shelved just yet. Recently, an interested buyer had come forward, ready to pay a handsome sum for one of her old scripts.\n\nCarrie, however, was hesitant to sell. She raised several concerns about the contract presented to her, and to her astonishment, the buyer was genuine enough to revise it accordingly.\n\nHolding the revised contract in her hands, Carrie inhaled deeply, her resolve hardening. She seemed to have reached a crucial decision.\n\nHer fingers danced over her phone's keyboard with swift precision, typing out a firm command. \"Create a divorce agreement following my terms and ensure it reaches Kristopher Norris at the Norris Group.\"\n\nWithout pausing for a response, she placed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step echoing a blend of determination and newfound independence.\n\nChapter 3 Exchange Of Conveniences\nThirty minutes had passed, Carrie finally heaved herself up from the bathtub, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. As she lifted her gaze, her own image in the mirror halted her movements--her skin appeared as smooth and impeccable as fine porcelain, glowing with an unblemished radiance.\n\nHer eyes, deep pools of allure, sparkled with an enchanting, soft warmth, inviting anyone who dared meet her gaze.\n\nDespite edging into her late twenties at twenty-five, she reveled in the fact that time had yet to etch its marks upon her flawless complexion.\n\nSurely, a woman with such a visage had no place for self-pity.\n\nAbsorbed in her contemplation, Carrie carelessly extended her right leg onto the cold floor, forgetting it was the very limb she had injured. Wrapped excessively in cling film to shield it from moisture, the tight encasement had stifled her circulation, rendering her leg eerily numb. As her foot touched down, it betrayed her, slipping forward unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Carrie gasped, her arms flailing in a frantic ballet, searching for a lifeline in the void.\n\nJust as she teetered on the brink of a painful rendezvous with the floor, the bathroom door burst open.\n\nKristopher stood at the entrance, his suit immaculately tailored, creating a striking figure. As their eyes locked, he paused, visibly taken aback, then quickly closed the distance with brisk strides.\n\nCarrie's breath caught as Kristopher swept her up in a graceful bridal style, an unexpected tightness wrapping around her waist. Caught off guard by his sudden appearance, Carrie realized with a jolt that she was completely bare. A flush of embarrassment washed over her as she instinctively clutched her hands over her chest.\n\nThis was their first moment of such intimacy since their wedding, and the discomfort made her toes curl inward, her skin blushing a delicate shade of pink.\n\nKristopher looked down at her with a mischievous grin. \"Let's be honest, there's not much to see,\" he teased gently.\n\nFeeling both mortified and slightly irritated, Carrie snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Norris, after all you've seen, I suppose nothing can impress you anymore.\"\n\nShe carried her C-cup curves with understated charm, a touch of sensuality that outshone Lise's painfully flat, almost awkwardly rigid build.\n\nYet Carrie knew well that without love, even the most perfect physique paled in comparison to the charm of one dearly cherished.\n\nNonchalantly, Kristopher reached for a bathrobe hanging behind the door and draped it over her. His frown deepened at her comment. \"What are you talking about, Carrie?\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike him, and his expression grew even more impatient. \"Tell me, did you send those divorce papers in the dead of night just to lure me back here--to catch you completely bare?\" His tone was a mix of disbelief and annoyance. \"I told you I was swamped with work. Was this dramatic display really necessary?\"\n\nCarrie's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the tension between them. He was always so quick to lose patience with her.\n\nShe wasn't the type to throw around words like divorce or breakups lightly. In fact, this was the first time she'd ever mentioned divorce in their two-year marriage, yet he seemed indifferent to her turmoil. He simply dismissed her concerns as if she were overreacting about trivial matters.\n\nDespite the throbbing pain in her leg, Carrie mustered her strength and said, \"Put me down.\"\n\nKristopher, however, paid no heed, his eyes scanning her leg swathed in bandages. His brow furrowed slightly. \"What happened to your leg? Is this some elaborate ploy to lure me back?\"\n\nAt his words, a bitter laugh escaped Carrie.\n\nIt seemed he viewed her as merely seeking attention, and in failing to capture it, she had likely concocted a story to draw him back, allowing her to dramatize her plight in his presence.\n\nWith a blank face, she replied untruthfully, \"It's a beauty treatment that shouldn't get wet.\"\n\n\"Why did you suddenly decide to undergo such a treatment?\" Kristopher inquired, his tone casual as he carried her outside, not pressing the issue further.\n\nHis frame was large, and through his thin shirt, she could distinctly feel the warmth of his body and the defined shape of his chest muscles.\n\nThe closeness created an uncomfortable tension for Carrie, who had resolved to end things once and for all.\n\nHer voice climbed involuntarily, sharper this time. \"Oh, since when have you been concerned with such minor things, Mr. Norris?\"\n\nFor the first time, Kristopher witnessed her using biting sarcasm; it struck him as peculiarly amusing. With a calm demeanor, he responded, \"You're my wife, it's only natural I'd be concerned about your well-being.\"\n\n\"Really?\" There was a somber note in Carrie's voice now. \"It seems like you've never really regarded me as your wife. I'm scared that if I were to die, you wouldn't even know until much later.\"\n\nAfter all, at that very moment, Kristopher had been distracted, lost in moments with his first love, too consumed to lend an ear to her desperate pleas.\n\nCaught off guard by her accusation, Kristopher's eyes widened with surprise before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. \"Carrie, what's brought on this sudden outburst of anger? Just because I was tied up this afternoon and missed your call? Perhaps I've been too indulgent with you lately, and it's made you a bit too presumptuous?\"\n\nCarrie froze, startled. Was he accusing her of being too presumptuous?\n\nShe realized their marriage had always been lopsided. In his eyes, she was nothing more than a transactional partner, a woman who had bartered her freedom for financial security.\n\nTheir union was meant to be a mere exchange of conveniences, yet she had, quite foolishly, fallen deeply in love with him.\n\nIn the tricky terrain of romance, the one who fell first invariably found themselves at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nKristopher's dismissive reaction left Carrie reeling, her emotions dismissed as trifles, a tight knot of suffocation rising in her chest.\n\n\"I said to put me down this instant!\" Carrie exclaimed, jerking her head to the side, her voice laced with a sharp edge of impatience.\n\nKristopher remained mute, effortlessly carrying her towards the bed before suddenly releasing his hold.\n\nCarrie felt a jolt as the support vanished, her heart skipping a beat as she instinctively grasped for him.\n\nTheir bodies collided on the bed, her bathrobe teetering on the brink of decency, threatening to unravel with any minor shift.\n\nPropped on one elbow, Kristopher gazed down at her, his lips curled into a sly, teasing grin. \"You wanted to be let go, didn't you? So why cling to me now?\"\n\nHis eyes, deep and sparkling like a midnight lake speckled with stars, captivated her.\n\nIn those celestial depths, Carrie caught a glimpse of her own reflection.\n\nAt times like this, she was misled into believing he harbored a deep affection.\n\nSadly, his heart was a fortress reserved for Lise, and all Carrie had left were empty fantasies.\n\n\"Boring!\" she exclaimed, her voice devoid of any enthusiasm as she attempted to rise, her hand inadvertently brushing against something unexpected.\n\nThe following moment brought a noticeable shift in his cock pressing against her stomach.\n\n\"Don't move, or I can't promise what might happen next,\" he warned in a deep, gravelly voice.\n\nWith a frown, Carrie internally cursed upon hearing the statement.\n\nIt was an undeniable fact. Primal instincts steered the actions of men. Absence of affection didn't quell their basic desires.\n\nYet, she dared not agitate Kristopher. Angling her face away, her body remained rigid, frozen in place.\n\nCarrie, feeling irked, shot back. \"Didn't you say there's nothing here to see? What's with the reaction now, Mr. Norris? Are you really that easy to impress?\"\n\nNo sooner had her words flown than she grasped the potential repercussions of her sharp tongue.\n\nA wave of regret surged through Carrie, but instead of anger, Kristopher responded with a chuckle, \"You are my wife, after all. Since that's something I can't alter, I might as well embrace it. Besides, it's been years since we became husband and wife--it would be a shame to neglect you completely.\"\n\nChapter 4 Are You Out Of Your Mind?\nKristopher slipped his hand beneath the folds of her bathrobe, his touch tracing the curve of Carrie's skin, as smooth and delicate as silk. He encircled her slender waist, drawing her closer with a gentle yet firm grip.\n\nHer face, a captivating canvas of defiance and visible irritation, ignited in him an uncontrollable urge to claim victory over her resistance.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy, yet he remained composed, slowly removing his tailored suit.\n\nThe fabric of his suit brushed lightly against Carrie's cheek, releasing a mix of scents: a familiar woody aroma intertwined with an unexpected zesty twist of lemon. It was unmistakably Jo Malone's Blue Agava and Cacao--Lise's signature scent.\n\nA surge of nausea overwhelmed Carrie at the realization.\n\nAs Kristopher's eyes, now shaded with a stormy intensity, drew nearer to hers, the proximity conjured unwelcome visions of him with Lise. Her stomach churned violently, and with a sudden movement, she pushed him away, propping herself up with a jolt and a dry retch.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer stomach had been empty all day, leaving her with nothing to bring up.\n\nThe desire in Kristopher's gaze flickered out, replaced by a cold, detached expression as he withdrew slightly.\n\nObserving the genuine distress and the reddening of Carrie's eyes, Kristopher perceived her reaction for outright disgust at their closeness.\n\nHe paused, fingers adjusting his shirt cuffs, his voice cold as he confronted her. \"Carrie, is this reaction reserved only for me, or is it how you respond to all men?\"\n\nThe air in the room turned frosty, thick with tension.\n\nCarrie swallowed the sharp sting in her throat, her eyes widening in shock as she stared up at him.\n\nEver since their marriage, she had cut ties with nearly all her male friends, yet here was Kristopher, casually tossing out comments sharp enough to cut glass.\n\nThe years of love she had poured into their relationship now seemed utterly futile.\n\nHeat crept up her neck, coloring her cheeks a bright scarlet as indignation took hold. Without thinking, her hand flew up and delivered a stinging slap across Kristopher's face.\n\nAll her suppressed grievances from the day ignited in that swift motion.\n\nHer bathrobe, loosened in the heat of the moment, slipped from her shoulders. Ignoring the flush of exposure, she swiftly gathered the fabric and draped it around herself, her movements quick and firm.\n\nThe impact of her slap had left a light, crimson mark on Kristopher's cheek, marking him with her outrage.\n\nHis eyes, wide with disbelief, met hers. \"Carrie, are you out of your mind?\"\n\nOut of her mind? Yes, she was clearly insane to ever fall for him in the first place.\n\nCarrie fumed silently, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nSuddenly, the sharp buzz of the phone on the table cut through the mounting tension, its vibration bringing a brief respite from their standoff.\n\nKristopher cast a fleeting glance at the message, shut off the phone with a snap, and strode towards the door, his back rigid with tension.\n\nHer voice, firm and unwavering, chased after him. \"We're getting a divorce! Make sure you sign those papers before you walk out that door!\"\n\nKristopher paused briefly and said sharply, \"I have something to do now. When I return, do whatever pleases you.\" With that, he forcefully shut the door.\n\nCarrie's eyes followed his unwavering exit, feeling an oppressive weight compressing her chest once again.\n\nShe disregarded the sharp sting in her leg and hobbled determinedly toward her tablet. Fingers trembling, she hastily navigated to Lise's Twitter page.\n\nLise had just uploaded a new tweet.\n\nThe photo showed her lying down with a fever patch adhered to her forehead, still enveloped in Kristopher's familiar jacket.\n\nThe caption read, \"Being sick makes me extra clingy. Wishing I had someone here. Stay cozy and take care, everyone!\"\n\nThe simultaneous timing of these two events made it almost impossible for Carrie not to suspect that Kristopher had dashed off to tend to Lise.\n\nCarrie's instincts loudly proclaimed that this was no accident; Lise had deliberately sought to tug at Kristopher's heartstrings. It appeared her tactics were effective.\n\nNot even Carrie's stark threat of divorce could overshadow Lise's theatrical display of vulnerability.\n\nSeething with fury, Carrie quaked like a leaf swept into a storm.\n\nShe steeled herself against the heartache, forcefully ripping the plastic wrap from her aching leg.\n\nAfter her lengthy soak, the bath's lingering moisture had infiltrated her skin, inflaming the wound until it was a vivid, angry red and painfully swollen.\n\nShe, too, could be clingy. Even in the harshest times back in the county, she had shown vulnerability, breaking down into soft sobs within the comforting arms of her grandmother, especially that one time she got burned by the scalding kettle.\n\nBut such vulnerability had its time and place, and it wasn't now.\n\nThe stark reality of Kristopher's exit forced Carrie to confront her need for self-reliance.\n\nBiting down hard on her lip, Carrie cleaned the throbbing wound with a practiced hand before securely wrapping it anew.\n\nShe rose with a newfound resolve and yanked a black suitcase from the far end of her expansive walk-in closet--it held all the belongings she'd brought into this house as a hopeful bride.\n\nShe grabbed a fresh set of clothes to slip into and left a bank card neatly on the bedside table.\n\nShe had transferred every penny she'd earned over the past year onto that card, effectively settling her financial entanglements with Kristopher over the last two years and cutting him out of her life for good.\n\nDragging the heavy suitcase behind her, she limped painfully out of the opulent villa.\n\nAs she passed through the gate, she wrapped her baseball jacket more tightly around her slight figure, her silhouette hauntingly solitary in the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe night air of early spring was bitingly cold, devoid of any trace of warmth, a chill that seemed almost faint compared to the ice forming in Carrie's shattered heart.\n\nShe had arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a heart full of dreams, and now she was leaving, dreams crumbled, utterly alone.\n\nA bitter laugh slipped through her lips. If only she hadn't fallen so hard for him, if only she'd proposed an amicable separation at the end of their agreed year, maybe she wouldn't be wandering now, a lost soul in the shadow of her former self.\n\nLise didn't have to lift a finger, and Carrie had already fallen, utterly broken and beyond redemption.\n\nChapter 5 A Gathering\nMeanwhile, in the Oasis Club, renowned as the priciest spot in Orkset, the air within the VIP room crackled with excitement. Under the spell of bright lights and thumping music, a diverse group of men and women lounged together, basking in the exclusivity of the setting.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, revealing Kristopher in the doorway.\n\nThe karaoke session halted abruptly as the crowd turned to greet him in unison, voices mingling. \"Kristopher...\"\n\nBefore they could utter another word, a woman cloaked from head to toe stepped out from behind him.\n\nLise, with a fluid motion, removed her mask and slid her arm through Kristopher's. She addressed the room with a poised charm. \"My assistant took a sudden leave, and I found myself without company. Not keen on spending the evening alone, I invited Kristopher to join me. I trust that's alright?\"\n\nLise's beauty was without question. Her face was a delicate composition of cherry lips and a sculpted nose, framed by eyes that shimmered with a vulnerable allure, commanding a protective fervor from those around her--her presence, ethereal.\n\nIn contrast, Carrie's features were more pronounced, her beauty vivid and striking. Lise, by comparison, carried a softer, more understated elegance.\n\nYet, as it often goes, matters of the heart followed no simple paths.\n\nWhile Kristopher and Carrie were married, it was in name only; Kristopher seemed detached and seldom included her in private social events.\n\nThe group didn't have much of a relationship with Carrie, leading them to feel no obligation to defend her.\n\nUpon hearing Lise's comment, a moment of discomfort rippled through the air. Nonetheless, they quickly recovered, offering a congenial smile as they said, \"We're all friends here; let's not bother with formalities.\"\n\nLise offered a subtle, knowing smile, as she gracefully accompanied Kristopher into the bustling room.\n\nThe event that evening had been meticulously planned to express appreciation for Kristopher's contributions.\n\nAs they stepped into the room, the crowd parted like the sea, making way for them to proceed to the seats of honor.\n\nThe group's leader handed Kristopher a glass of wine with a flourish, proclaiming with a broad grin, \"We truly owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Norris! Your exceptional talents are the talk of the town, and witnessing them firsthand today only confirms it. Without your expertise, securing this contract would have been a fantasy!\"\n\nTheir gathering marked the launch of a novel shopping platform, one that had been in negotiation with numerous local brands in Orkset. But the scenario changed dramatically when the tech giant JoyBuy dramatically entered the scene, stirring up the competitive landscape.\n\nCompeting with JoyBuy was akin to the classic David versus Goliath tale--hopelessly daunting. In a surge of desperation, they turned to Kristopher, reaching out through a network of connections for his renowned strategic prowess.\n\nWith his characteristic swiftness, Kristopher hatched an ingenious plan and swiftly secured the deal, snatching it from the clutches of JoyBuy right before the business association could ink their agreement--a masterful coup that reverberated success.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround only intensified the already deep respect everyone held for Kristopher.\n\nAlbin Murray, beaming with pride, couldn't help but boast, \"Ah, just look at the caliber of his friends! They thought they could steal deals right under our noses, obviously underestimating Kristopher's clout!\"\n\nAlbin, born into the wealthy Murray family, counted himself among Kristopher's closest friends. He was renowned for his sprawling social web--a network through which the desperate plea for help was channeled to Kristopher.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristopher himself, the focus of all their discussions, reclined nonchalantly on the couch, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe was well-versed in the art of receiving compliments; thus, his expression stayed calm and detached.\n\nThe ambient light sculpted his angular features, casting dramatic shadows that emphasized his high nose bridge and sharply cut jawline, as though he were a living masterpiece.\n\nHis natural grace and detachment eclipsed any terrestrial magnificence.\n\nFollowing a sequence of celebratory toasts, when it became apparent that Kristopher merely touched his glass without truly drinking, the rest of the company toned down their conversation, allowing him a moment of repose with his eyes gently shut.\n\nLise, slightly feverish, opted not to indulge in the spirits, choosing instead to sit in serene silence next to Kristopher, her eyes lingering on him with a look of deep, unmistakable adoration.\n\nAlbin, captivated by the seemingly perfect pair, pondered the whims of destiny. He discreetly captured their image with his smartphone and nonchalantly shared it across his social networks.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the liquor dwindled, the room's door swung open anew.\n\nKristopher's personal assistant, Oliver Brooks, made his entrance, acknowledging the gathering with a courteous nod that bordered on respect but avoided groveling, swiftly positioning himself in front of Kristopher.\n\nSilence hung in the air, yet Lise, unable to contain her curiosity, leaned in and whispered, \"What's going on?\"\n\nOliver, maintaining his focus on Kristopher, chose not to respond directly to her.\n\nA flush of embarrassment tinted Lise's cheeks as she turned towards Kristopher, hesitatingly inquiring, \"Should I leave?\"\n\nKristopher adjusted his posture, his voice low and calm as he instructed, \"Go ahead, speak.\"\n\nA shiver of apprehension coursed through Oliver as he tentatively began, \"Mr. Norris, Mrs. Norris has departed from Bayview Villa, and...\"\n\n&9&\n0:00 / 4:50",

        "primary_text": "\"He finally remembered the woman waiting for him at home, only to face her divorce papers. Confident she'd regret it, he signed. But post-divorce, she blossomed, turning heads everywhere. Defeated, he begged to win her back!\n=====\nIn the bustling, weathered heart of Orkset, flames erupted violently within an ancient apartment building. Propelled by gusts of wind, the fire devoured the structure, belching dense smoke and bright, searing tongues of flame.\n\n\"Saved! They've been saved.\" The words echoed amidst the chaos.\n\nFirefighters emerged from the smoldering inferno, carrying Carrie Campbell to safety at the roadside.\n\nHer features, usually refined and expressive, were now smeared with soot; her sparkling eyes dimmed to a vacant gaze, hollow and lost.\n\nAs reality seeped back into her consciousness, Carrie felt a rush of gratitude overpower her usual composure. Her voice, hoarse and weak, conveyed a profound \"thank you\" to her rescuers. Shaking, she fumbled for her phone, her fingertips quivering as they found the familiar number.\n\n\"Hello, the person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe automated message played after a few rings, leaving her with a lump in her throat, her unvoiced frustrations and sorrow welling up inside her.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a deafening roar, the explosion abruptly silenced the cold, mechanical voice echoing through the line. Carrie's head snapped upwards, shock painted on her face as she witnessed the apartment she had just exited erupt into flames.\n\nChunks of debris were hurled into the air by the force of the blast, scattering across the sky.\n\nPanic engulfed the crowd as survivors, freshly rescued, screamed in terror. They huddled together, seeking solace in each other's arms, their cries piercing the tumultuous scene. In stark contrast, Carrie lay alone on a stretcher, her isolation magnified amidst the chaos.\n\n\"Kristopher...\" Fighting the dread creeping up her spine, Carrie pressed her lips together tightly and dialed her husband's number again, her resolve unwavering.\n\nYet, the call disconnected after a few short rings, leaving her with a haunting silence.\n\nJust then, a Twitter notification flickered on her phone screen.\n\nThe gossip feed was alive with the latest gossip: #LiseNash #MysteriouBoyfriend.\n\nAccording to the tweet, a producer from a well-known variety show had invited the renowned star Lise Nash to a dinner, which had quickly soured when she declined to partake in a toast.\n\nThis act of defiance had sparked a confrontation, only to be interrupted by Lise's domineering boyfriend. He stormed into the private dining room, dismissing the producer with a dismissive wave and escorting Lise away.\n\nThe tweet described the scene vividly, painting a picture of a powerful man defending his beloved partner.\n\nYet, perhaps due to his prominence, only the back of the man was visible in the accompanying photos, preserving his anonymity. Meanwhile, Lise, donning an oversized suit jacket, beamed a smile, reaching out to clasp his hand as they departed together.\n\nCarrie's eyes were glued to the screen, her stare intense and unblinking as she absorbed the image before her.\n\nThere he was--Kristopher Norris!\n\nThe suit jacket draped carelessly over Lise was a dead giveaway.\n\nEvery piece of clothing Kristopher owned had been meticulously tailored by a master craftsman abroad, a detail Carrie knew all too well.\n\nHer grip on her phone tightened, her knuckles blanching to a stark white, as if her very soul were being squeezed by an invisible hand, the pain sharp and acid-like in its intensity.\n\nIn her most desperate moment, Kristopher had coldly disconnected their call, choosing instead to be at Lise's side.\n\nWhat was the worth of their two-year marriage?\n\nThe tears she had been holding back now overwhelmed her, streaming down her face.\n\nEven as she tilted her head back in a futile attempt to stem the flow, the tears continued to escape.\n\nLise had always been Kristopher's first love, a fact whispered and gossiped about among their circles. The Norris family had never approved of Lise, seeing her ordinary background as unfitting.\n\nForced apart by family pressures, it had been Lise who ended things, but the past, it seemed, was not easily left behind.\n\nKristopher had diligently pursued the leadership of the Norris family, harboring dreams of finally being with Lise.\n\nYet, when he reached his goal, he discovered that Lise had already chosen another.\n\nIn defiance of his family's expectations and perhaps out of bitterness, Kristopher turned to Carrie, a woman equally devoid of wealth or status, to become Mrs. Norris, thereby blocking any matchmaking attempts by his relatives.\n\nAt that time, Carrie faced immense pressure from her father, Tristan Campbell, who was pushing her towards a marriage with a playboy, the son of a business associate, to cover her grandmother's steep medical expenses.\n\nBoth Kristopher and Carrie, driven by their personal motives, consented to a marriage of convenience.\n\nOriginally set for just one year, their contractual marriage stretched beyond its term, sustained by a shared understanding between them.\n\nOver time, Carrie began to believe in the authenticity of their union, never suspecting that it was merely an extension of her hopes.\n\nJust moments ago, a fire had nearly claimed Carrie's life. In that critical moment, she reached out to Kristopher, only to be twice rebuffed as he spent his time with Lise.\n\nThis harsh reality shattered Carrie's illusions, revealing that her perceived transition from pretense to genuine relationship was nothing but a facade maintained by her own desires.\n\nCarrie wasn't even a temporary substitute in Kristopher's life but merely a pawn used to spite his family.\n\nAfter a poignant pause, tears welled up in Carrie's eyes, unstoppable and poignant.\n\nIt might be time for her to release herself from the shackles of her own hopeful delusions--to stop deceiving herself.\n\nChapter 2 Trending Topics\nThe overwhelming number of injuries from the fire was staggering, straining the already frantic doctors and nurses as they tried to provide aid.\n\nCarrie had been merely grazed by a splintered clothes rack, which left a deep, jagged wound on her calf. In comparison to the chaos around her, her wounds seemed almost negligible.\n\nShe managed to get basic care--a brisk cleaning and a quick wrap of bandages--at a local hospital before catching a cab back to her house.\n\nBayview Villa, a grand property under Kristopher's name, was technically their matrimonial residence.\n\nLiving alone had become the norm for Carrie, as Kristopher was hardly ever around. She had bid farewell to the housekeeper, discovering that her life could be quite adequately maintained with just takeout, deliveries, and the occasional visit from a part-time cleaner.\n\nNow, she found herself the sole occupant of the sprawling living room, sinking into the sofa, her gaze drifting across the empty space.\n\nThe stark, monochrome decor did nothing to imbue warmth into the atmosphere.\n\nA chilling realization crept up on her: this vast, elegant space felt more like a colossal tomb, a silent grave for her lost years of youth and a love that had quietly slipped away.\n\nIn this cold, echoing house, would anyone even notice if her breath ceased one day?\n\nCarrie exhaled a weary sigh, her frame heavy as she leaned against the cold wall for support, struggling up the stairs to her bedroom on the second floor.\n\nEach step was a battle, sending stabbing pains shooting through her from the surface of her skin down to her aching bones.\n\nThe house, stark and hollow, echoed even the smallest sounds, magnifying her sense of isolation.\n\nIt was today, amidst this profound silence, that Carrie truly grasped the all-encompassing nature of her loneliness--it was almost tangible, enveloping her senses with its texture and mournful whispers, tightening around her heart like a vice, producing a dull, relentless ache.\n\nUpon reaching the sanctuary of her bedroom, she collapsed onto the bed, the very embodiment of exhaustion, feeling it both physically and spiritually.\n\nJust as she surrendered to this weariness, the sharp ring of the phone pierced the silence.\n\n\"You reached out to me earlier. What do you need?\" Kristopher's voice cut through the line, cold and distant as ever.\n\nCarrie was caught off guard by his unexpected call. Words failed her as she parted her lips to respond, but before she could collect her thoughts, a soft, feminine voice floated through from the other end. \"Kristopher, will you join me to...\"\n\nA surge of emotions tightened Carrie's grip on the phone, her heart thumping louder with each second. Overwhelmed and unable to contain her rising panic, she demanded, \"Who's there with you?\"\n\nKristopher gave no answer, merely stating in a flat, disinterested voice, \"If there's something you need, let's catch up when I'm back. I have pressing engagements right now, so I must disconnect.\"\n\nHe promptly ended the call, cutting off any chance for Carrie to reply.\n\nAs the harsh beep of the disconnected line filled her ears, Carrie's lips twisted into a rueful grin. How utterly foolish she felt! Deep down, she knew his response all too well, yet she had clung to the hope of hearing his voice confirm it.\n\nWith a sense of self-inflicted irony, Carrie activated her tablet and scrolled through the day's hot topics.\n\nOne headline caught her eye: \"A female star shielded from harassment at a dinner by her formidable partner.\" A wry smile twisted her lips.\n\nCarrie knew all too well what it was like to face harassment at those kinds of dinners.\n\nShe vividly remembered her first major audition after her entering the showbiz; her agent had escorted her to a dinner with the influential director and producer of the drama series \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nAs a novice in the dizzying world of showbiz, Carrie had felt incredibly vulnerable, uncertain of how to navigate the murky waters of such gatherings.\n\nThe producer had eyed her shamelessly, sneering as he asked, \"Is this the new talent you're introducing? She appears presentable, but I'm curious to see how she fares with a drink. Here's the deal, if you can gulp down this bottle in one go, I'll secure you an audition for the lead role.\"\n\nCarrie was inclined to decline, but under the relentless pressure from her agent, she found herself compelled to consume the entire bottle.\n\nAs the evening wore on, she was hurriedly taken to the hospital suffering from a severe stomach ailment.\n\nHer agent, fretful about the prospect of the role slipping away to another, quickly settled the hospital charges and departed.\n\nAt that time, Carrie found herself isolated in a hospital bed for several long days.\n\nYet, even before Carrie could be released from the hospital, the media was abuzz with the announcement that Lise had secured the lead role in \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nSubsequently, her agent rebuked Carrie for her lack of ambition, complaining, \"You are more appealing than Lise, so why can't you show more drive? She cozied up to Mr. Norris and hardly had to make an effort. She's surrounded by people eager to cater to her every need. I've heard that Mr. Norris personally orchestrated her landing the lead role in this production!\"\n\nWhen the show premiered, Lise was catapulted into stardom, swiftly ascending to the elite echelons of the acting world.\n\nFrom that moment forward, Carrie let her acting aspirations wane and chose instead to devote herself entirely to supporting her husband, Kristopher.\n\nAfter all, no matter her efforts, she could never get the same career opportunities that Lise seemed to receive effortlessly with Kristopher's offhand remarks.\n\nAt that time, Carrie had believed she was filling the role that was meant to be Lise's as Mrs. Norris, which meant she owed Lise.\n\nBy giving up the career opportunities to Lise, Carrie thought they would settle their unspoken debt.\n\nHowever, Carrie hadn't foreseen that Lise would claim both the coveted career and Kristopher's affections.\n\nAs Lise's professional and love life blossomed, Carrie came to the painful realization that she had been overly consumed with her romantic pursuits, at the expense of her career, and now, she found herself bereft of both love and professional fulfillment.\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Carrie viewed her past two years as tragically misguided.\n\nGiven another opportunity, she resolved she wouldn't be so unguarded, letting her heart recklessly fall captive to Kristopher's charm.\n\n\"Ms. Spencer, the new copyright contract is prepared. Please review it for any discrepancies.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed with the alert, snapping Carrie out of her reverie. She gazed at the PDF file attached in the message, her mind briefly overwhelmed.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Katrina Spencer, Carrie had once made a name for herself as a budding screenwriter, selling numerous scripts in her early days.\n\nDuring her early career as Katrina, Carrie often sold her work for a pittance, compelled by her urgent need for immediate cash.\n\nOver the years, these scripts transformed into blockbuster films and hit series, catapulting Katrina's reputation to new heights.\n\nBy this time, Carrie had married Kristopher and was no longer plagued by the financial woes that had once driven her to desperation--her grandmother's hefty medical bills were a thing of the past. With her financial crises resolved, Carrie's life had pivoted to domestic responsibilities, striving to be an exemplary wife to Kristopher. Amidst these changes, her pseudonym, Katrina Spencer, gradually receded into the background.\n\nHowever, her past as Katrina wasn't ready to be shelved just yet. Recently, an interested buyer had come forward, ready to pay a handsome sum for one of her old scripts.\n\nCarrie, however, was hesitant to sell. She raised several concerns about the contract presented to her, and to her astonishment, the buyer was genuine enough to revise it accordingly.\n\nHolding the revised contract in her hands, Carrie inhaled deeply, her resolve hardening. She seemed to have reached a crucial decision.\n\nHer fingers danced over her phone's keyboard with swift precision, typing out a firm command. \"Create a divorce agreement following my terms and ensure it reaches Kristopher Norris at the Norris Group.\"\n\nWithout pausing for a response, she placed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step echoing a blend of determination and newfound independence.\n\nChapter 3 Exchange Of Conveniences\nThirty minutes had passed, Carrie finally heaved herself up from the bathtub, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. As she lifted her gaze, her own image in the mirror halted her movements--her skin appeared as smooth and impeccable as fine porcelain, glowing with an unblemished radiance.\n\nHer eyes, deep pools of allure, sparkled with an enchanting, soft warmth, inviting anyone who dared meet her gaze.\n\nDespite edging into her late twenties at twenty-five, she reveled in the fact that time had yet to etch its marks upon her flawless complexion.\n\nSurely, a woman with such a visage had no place for self-pity.\n\nAbsorbed in her contemplation, Carrie carelessly extended her right leg onto the cold floor, forgetting it was the very limb she had injured. Wrapped excessively in cling film to shield it from moisture, the tight encasement had stifled her circulation, rendering her leg eerily numb. As her foot touched down, it betrayed her, slipping forward unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Carrie gasped, her arms flailing in a frantic ballet, searching for a lifeline in the void.\n\nJust as she teetered on the brink of a painful rendezvous with the floor, the bathroom door burst open.\n\nKristopher stood at the entrance, his suit immaculately tailored, creating a striking figure. As their eyes locked, he paused, visibly taken aback, then quickly closed the distance with brisk strides.\n\nCarrie's breath caught as Kristopher swept her up in a graceful bridal style, an unexpected tightness wrapping around her waist. Caught off guard by his sudden appearance, Carrie realized with a jolt that she was completely bare. A flush of embarrassment washed over her as she instinctively clutched her hands over her chest.\n\nThis was their first moment of such intimacy since their wedding, and the discomfort made her toes curl inward, her skin blushing a delicate shade of pink.\n\nKristopher looked down at her with a mischievous grin. \"Let's be honest, there's not much to see,\" he teased gently.\n\nFeeling both mortified and slightly irritated, Carrie snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Norris, after all you've seen, I suppose nothing can impress you anymore.\"\n\nShe carried her C-cup curves with understated charm, a touch of sensuality that outshone Lise's painfully flat, almost awkwardly rigid build.\n\nYet Carrie knew well that without love, even the most perfect physique paled in comparison to the charm of one dearly cherished.\n\nNonchalantly, Kristopher reached for a bathrobe hanging behind the door and draped it over her. His frown deepened at her comment. \"What are you talking about, Carrie?\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike him, and his expression grew even more impatient. \"Tell me, did you send those divorce papers in the dead of night just to lure me back here--to catch you completely bare?\" His tone was a mix of disbelief and annoyance. \"I told you I was swamped with work. Was this dramatic display really necessary?\"\n\nCarrie's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the tension between them. He was always so quick to lose patience with her.\n\nShe wasn't the type to throw around words like divorce or breakups lightly. In fact, this was the first time she'd ever mentioned divorce in their two-year marriage, yet he seemed indifferent to her turmoil. He simply dismissed her concerns as if she were overreacting about trivial matters.\n\nDespite the throbbing pain in her leg, Carrie mustered her strength and said, \"Put me down.\"\n\nKristopher, however, paid no heed, his eyes scanning her leg swathed in bandages. His brow furrowed slightly. \"What happened to your leg? Is this some elaborate ploy to lure me back?\"\n\nAt his words, a bitter laugh escaped Carrie.\n\nIt seemed he viewed her as merely seeking attention, and in failing to capture it, she had likely concocted a story to draw him back, allowing her to dramatize her plight in his presence.\n\nWith a blank face, she replied untruthfully, \"It's a beauty treatment that shouldn't get wet.\"\n\n\"Why did you suddenly decide to undergo such a treatment?\" Kristopher inquired, his tone casual as he carried her outside, not pressing the issue further.\n\nHis frame was large, and through his thin shirt, she could distinctly feel the warmth of his body and the defined shape of his chest muscles.\n\nThe closeness created an uncomfortable tension for Carrie, who had resolved to end things once and for all.\n\nHer voice climbed involuntarily, sharper this time. \"Oh, since when have you been concerned with such minor things, Mr. Norris?\"\n\nFor the first time, Kristopher witnessed her using biting sarcasm; it struck him as peculiarly amusing. With a calm demeanor, he responded, \"You're my wife, it's only natural I'd be concerned about your well-being.\"\n\n\"Really?\" There was a somber note in Carrie's voice now. \"It seems like you've never really regarded me as your wife. I'm scared that if I were to die, you wouldn't even know until much later.\"\n\nAfter all, at that very moment, Kristopher had been distracted, lost in moments with his first love, too consumed to lend an ear to her desperate pleas.\n\nCaught off guard by her accusation, Kristopher's eyes widened with surprise before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. \"Carrie, what's brought on this sudden outburst of anger? Just because I was tied up this afternoon and missed your call? Perhaps I've been too indulgent with you lately, and it's made you a bit too presumptuous?\"\n\nCarrie froze, startled. Was he accusing her of being too presumptuous?\n\nShe realized their marriage had always been lopsided. In his eyes, she was nothing more than a transactional partner, a woman who had bartered her freedom for financial security.\n\nTheir union was meant to be a mere exchange of conveniences, yet she had, quite foolishly, fallen deeply in love with him.\n\nIn the tricky terrain of romance, the one who fell first invariably found themselves at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nKristopher's dismissive reaction left Carrie reeling, her emotions dismissed as trifles, a tight knot of suffocation rising in her chest.\n\n\"I said to put me down this instant!\" Carrie exclaimed, jerking her head to the side, her voice laced with a sharp edge of impatience.\n\nKristopher remained mute, effortlessly carrying her towards the bed before suddenly releasing his hold.\n\nCarrie felt a jolt as the support vanished, her heart skipping a beat as she instinctively grasped for him.\n\nTheir bodies collided on the bed, her bathrobe teetering on the brink of decency, threatening to unravel with any minor shift.\n\nPropped on one elbow, Kristopher gazed down at her, his lips curled into a sly, teasing grin. \"You wanted to be let go, didn't you? So why cling to me now?\"\n\nHis eyes, deep and sparkling like a midnight lake speckled with stars, captivated her.\n\nIn those celestial depths, Carrie caught a glimpse of her own reflection.\n\nAt times like this, she was misled into believing he harbored a deep affection.\n\nSadly, his heart was a fortress reserved for Lise, and all Carrie had left were empty fantasies.\n\n\"Boring!\" she exclaimed, her voice devoid of any enthusiasm as she attempted to rise, her hand inadvertently brushing against something unexpected.\n\nThe following moment brought a noticeable shift in his cock pressing against her stomach.\n\n\"Don't move, or I can't promise what might happen next,\" he warned in a deep, gravelly voice.\n\nWith a frown, Carrie internally cursed upon hearing the statement.\n\nIt was an undeniable fact. Primal instincts steered the actions of men. Absence of affection didn't quell their basic desires.\n\nYet, she dared not agitate Kristopher. Angling her face away, her body remained rigid, frozen in place.\n\nCarrie, feeling irked, shot back. \"Didn't you say there's nothing here to see? What's with the reaction now, Mr. Norris? Are you really that easy to impress?\"\n\nNo sooner had her words flown than she grasped the potential repercussions of her sharp tongue.\n\nA wave of regret surged through Carrie, but instead of anger, Kristopher responded with a chuckle, \"You are my wife, after all. Since that's something I can't alter, I might as well embrace it. Besides, it's been years since we became husband and wife--it would be a shame to neglect you completely.\"\n\nChapter 4 Are You Out Of Your Mind?\nKristopher slipped his hand beneath the folds of her bathrobe, his touch tracing the curve of Carrie's skin, as smooth and delicate as silk. He encircled her slender waist, drawing her closer with a gentle yet firm grip.\n\nHer face, a captivating canvas of defiance and visible irritation, ignited in him an uncontrollable urge to claim victory over her resistance.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy, yet he remained composed, slowly removing his tailored suit.\n\nThe fabric of his suit brushed lightly against Carrie's cheek, releasing a mix of scents: a familiar woody aroma intertwined with an unexpected zesty twist of lemon. It was unmistakably Jo Malone's Blue Agava and Cacao--Lise's signature scent.\n\nA surge of nausea overwhelmed Carrie at the realization.\n\nAs Kristopher's eyes, now shaded with a stormy intensity, drew nearer to hers, the proximity conjured unwelcome visions of him with Lise. Her stomach churned violently, and with a sudden movement, she pushed him away, propping herself up with a jolt and a dry retch.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer stomach had been empty all day, leaving her with nothing to bring up.\n\nThe desire in Kristopher's gaze flickered out, replaced by a cold, detached expression as he withdrew slightly.\n\nObserving the genuine distress and the reddening of Carrie's eyes, Kristopher perceived her reaction for outright disgust at their closeness.\n\nHe paused, fingers adjusting his shirt cuffs, his voice cold as he confronted her. \"Carrie, is this reaction reserved only for me, or is it how you respond to all men?\"\n\nThe air in the room turned frosty, thick with tension.\n\nCarrie swallowed the sharp sting in her throat, her eyes widening in shock as she stared up at him.\n\nEver since their marriage, she had cut ties with nearly all her male friends, yet here was Kristopher, casually tossing out comments sharp enough to cut glass.\n\nThe years of love she had poured into their relationship now seemed utterly futile.\n\nHeat crept up her neck, coloring her cheeks a bright scarlet as indignation took hold. Without thinking, her hand flew up and delivered a stinging slap across Kristopher's face.\n\nAll her suppressed grievances from the day ignited in that swift motion.\n\nHer bathrobe, loosened in the heat of the moment, slipped from her shoulders. Ignoring the flush of exposure, she swiftly gathered the fabric and draped it around herself, her movements quick and firm.\n\nThe impact of her slap had left a light, crimson mark on Kristopher's cheek, marking him with her outrage.\n\nHis eyes, wide with disbelief, met hers. \"Carrie, are you out of your mind?\"\n\nOut of her mind? Yes, she was clearly insane to ever fall for him in the first place.\n\nCarrie fumed silently, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nSuddenly, the sharp buzz of the phone on the table cut through the mounting tension, its vibration bringing a brief respite from their standoff.\n\nKristopher cast a fleeting glance at the message, shut off the phone with a snap, and strode towards the door, his back rigid with tension.\n\nHer voice, firm and unwavering, chased after him. \"We're getting a divorce! Make sure you sign those papers before you walk out that door!\"\n\nKristopher paused briefly and said sharply, \"I have something to do now. When I return, do whatever pleases you.\" With that, he forcefully shut the door.\n\nCarrie's eyes followed his unwavering exit, feeling an oppressive weight compressing her chest once again.\n\nShe disregarded the sharp sting in her leg and hobbled determinedly toward her tablet. Fingers trembling, she hastily navigated to Lise's Twitter page.\n\nLise had just uploaded a new tweet.\n\nThe photo showed her lying down with a fever patch adhered to her forehead, still enveloped in Kristopher's familiar jacket.\n\nThe caption read, \"Being sick makes me extra clingy. Wishing I had someone here. Stay cozy and take care, everyone!\"\n\nThe simultaneous timing of these two events made it almost impossible for Carrie not to suspect that Kristopher had dashed off to tend to Lise.\n\nCarrie's instincts loudly proclaimed that this was no accident; Lise had deliberately sought to tug at Kristopher's heartstrings. It appeared her tactics were effective.\n\nNot even Carrie's stark threat of divorce could overshadow Lise's theatrical display of vulnerability.\n\nSeething with fury, Carrie quaked like a leaf swept into a storm.\n\nShe steeled herself against the heartache, forcefully ripping the plastic wrap from her aching leg.\n\nAfter her lengthy soak, the bath's lingering moisture had infiltrated her skin, inflaming the wound until it was a vivid, angry red and painfully swollen.\n\nShe, too, could be clingy. Even in the harshest times back in the county, she had shown vulnerability, breaking down into soft sobs within the comforting arms of her grandmother, especially that one time she got burned by the scalding kettle.\n\nBut such vulnerability had its time and place, and it wasn't now.\n\nThe stark reality of Kristopher's exit forced Carrie to confront her need for self-reliance.\n\nBiting down hard on her lip, Carrie cleaned the throbbing wound with a practiced hand before securely wrapping it anew.\n\nShe rose with a newfound resolve and yanked a black suitcase from the far end of her expansive walk-in closet--it held all the belongings she'd brought into this house as a hopeful bride.\n\nShe grabbed a fresh set of clothes to slip into and left a bank card neatly on the bedside table.\n\nShe had transferred every penny she'd earned over the past year onto that card, effectively settling her financial entanglements with Kristopher over the last two years and cutting him out of her life for good.\n\nDragging the heavy suitcase behind her, she limped painfully out of the opulent villa.\n\nAs she passed through the gate, she wrapped her baseball jacket more tightly around her slight figure, her silhouette hauntingly solitary in the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe night air of early spring was bitingly cold, devoid of any trace of warmth, a chill that seemed almost faint compared to the ice forming in Carrie's shattered heart.\n\nShe had arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a heart full of dreams, and now she was leaving, dreams crumbled, utterly alone.\n\nA bitter laugh slipped through her lips. If only she hadn't fallen so hard for him, if only she'd proposed an amicable separation at the end of their agreed year, maybe she wouldn't be wandering now, a lost soul in the shadow of her former self.\n\nLise didn't have to lift a finger, and Carrie had already fallen, utterly broken and beyond redemption.\n\nChapter 5 A Gathering\nMeanwhile, in the Oasis Club, renowned as the priciest spot in Orkset, the air within the VIP room crackled with excitement. Under the spell of bright lights and thumping music, a diverse group of men and women lounged together, basking in the exclusivity of the setting.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, revealing Kristopher in the doorway.\n\nThe karaoke session halted abruptly as the crowd turned to greet him in unison, voices mingling. \"Kristopher...\"\n\nBefore they could utter another word, a woman cloaked from head to toe stepped out from behind him.\n\nLise, with a fluid motion, removed her mask and slid her arm through Kristopher's. She addressed the room with a poised charm. \"My assistant took a sudden leave, and I found myself without company. Not keen on spending the evening alone, I invited Kristopher to join me. I trust that's alright?\"\n\nLise's beauty was without question. Her face was a delicate composition of cherry lips and a sculpted nose, framed by eyes that shimmered with a vulnerable allure, commanding a protective fervor from those around her--her presence, ethereal.\n\nIn contrast, Carrie's features were more pronounced, her beauty vivid and striking. Lise, by comparison, carried a softer, more understated elegance.\n\nYet, as it often goes, matters of the heart followed no simple paths.\n\nWhile Kristopher and Carrie were married, it was in name only; Kristopher seemed detached and seldom included her in private social events.\n\nThe group didn't have much of a relationship with Carrie, leading them to feel no obligation to defend her.\n\nUpon hearing Lise's comment, a moment of discomfort rippled through the air. Nonetheless, they quickly recovered, offering a congenial smile as they said, \"We're all friends here; let's not bother with formalities.\"\n\nLise offered a subtle, knowing smile, as she gracefully accompanied Kristopher into the bustling room.\n\nThe event that evening had been meticulously planned to express appreciation for Kristopher's contributions.\n\nAs they stepped into the room, the crowd parted like the sea, making way for them to proceed to the seats of honor.\n\nThe group's leader handed Kristopher a glass of wine with a flourish, proclaiming with a broad grin, \"We truly owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Norris! Your exceptional talents are the talk of the town, and witnessing them firsthand today only confirms it. Without your expertise, securing this contract would have been a fantasy!\"\n\nTheir gathering marked the launch of a novel shopping platform, one that had been in negotiation with numerous local brands in Orkset. But the scenario changed dramatically when the tech giant JoyBuy dramatically entered the scene, stirring up the competitive landscape.\n\nCompeting with JoyBuy was akin to the classic David versus Goliath tale--hopelessly daunting. In a surge of desperation, they turned to Kristopher, reaching out through a network of connections for his renowned strategic prowess.\n\nWith his characteristic swiftness, Kristopher hatched an ingenious plan and swiftly secured the deal, snatching it from the clutches of JoyBuy right before the business association could ink their agreement--a masterful coup that reverberated success.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround only intensified the already deep respect everyone held for Kristopher.\n\nAlbin Murray, beaming with pride, couldn't help but boast, \"Ah, just look at the caliber of his friends! They thought they could steal deals right under our noses, obviously underestimating Kristopher's clout!\"\n\nAlbin, born into the wealthy Murray family, counted himself among Kristopher's closest friends. He was renowned for his sprawling social web--a network through which the desperate plea for help was channeled to Kristopher.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristopher himself, the focus of all their discussions, reclined nonchalantly on the couch, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe was well-versed in the art of receiving compliments; thus, his expression stayed calm and detached.\n\nThe ambient light sculpted his angular features, casting dramatic shadows that emphasized his high nose bridge and sharply cut jawline, as though he were a living masterpiece.\n\nHis natural grace and detachment eclipsed any terrestrial magnificence.\n\nFollowing a sequence of celebratory toasts, when it became apparent that Kristopher merely touched his glass without truly drinking, the rest of the company toned down their conversation, allowing him a moment of repose with his eyes gently shut.\n\nLise, slightly feverish, opted not to indulge in the spirits, choosing instead to sit in serene silence next to Kristopher, her eyes lingering on him with a look of deep, unmistakable adoration.\n\nAlbin, captivated by the seemingly perfect pair, pondered the whims of destiny. He discreetly captured their image with his smartphone and nonchalantly shared it across his social networks.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the liquor dwindled, the room's door swung open anew.\n\nKristopher's personal assistant, Oliver Brooks, made his entrance, acknowledging the gathering with a courteous nod that bordered on respect but avoided groveling, swiftly positioning himself in front of Kristopher.\n\nSilence hung in the air, yet Lise, unable to contain her curiosity, leaned in and whispered, \"What's going on?\"\n\nOliver, maintaining his focus on Kristopher, chose not to respond directly to her.\n\nA flush of embarrassment tinted Lise's cheeks as she turned towards Kristopher, hesitatingly inquiring, \"Should I leave?\"\n\nKristopher adjusted his posture, his voice low and calm as he instructed, \"Go ahead, speak.\"\n\nA shiver of apprehension coursed through Oliver as he tentatively began, \"Mr. Norris, Mrs. Norris has departed from Bayview Villa, and...\"\n\n&9&\n0:00 / 4:50",

        "primary_text": "\"He finally remembered the woman waiting for him at home, only to face her divorce papers. Confident she'd regret it, he signed. But post-divorce, she blossomed, turning heads everywhere. Defeated, he begged to win her back!\n=====\nIn the bustling, weathered heart of Orkset, flames erupted violently within an ancient apartment building. Propelled by gusts of wind, the fire devoured the structure, belching dense smoke and bright, searing tongues of flame.\n\n\"Saved! They've been saved.\" The words echoed amidst the chaos.\n\nFirefighters emerged from the smoldering inferno, carrying Carrie Campbell to safety at the roadside.\n\nHer features, usually refined and expressive, were now smeared with soot; her sparkling eyes dimmed to a vacant gaze, hollow and lost.\n\nAs reality seeped back into her consciousness, Carrie felt a rush of gratitude overpower her usual composure. Her voice, hoarse and weak, conveyed a profound \"thank you\" to her rescuers. Shaking, she fumbled for her phone, her fingertips quivering as they found the familiar number.\n\n\"Hello, the person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe automated message played after a few rings, leaving her with a lump in her throat, her unvoiced frustrations and sorrow welling up inside her.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a deafening roar, the explosion abruptly silenced the cold, mechanical voice echoing through the line. Carrie's head snapped upwards, shock painted on her face as she witnessed the apartment she had just exited erupt into flames.\n\nChunks of debris were hurled into the air by the force of the blast, scattering across the sky.\n\nPanic engulfed the crowd as survivors, freshly rescued, screamed in terror. They huddled together, seeking solace in each other's arms, their cries piercing the tumultuous scene. In stark contrast, Carrie lay alone on a stretcher, her isolation magnified amidst the chaos.\n\n\"Kristopher...\" Fighting the dread creeping up her spine, Carrie pressed her lips together tightly and dialed her husband's number again, her resolve unwavering.\n\nYet, the call disconnected after a few short rings, leaving her with a haunting silence.\n\nJust then, a Twitter notification flickered on her phone screen.\n\nThe gossip feed was alive with the latest gossip: #LiseNash #MysteriouBoyfriend.\n\nAccording to the tweet, a producer from a well-known variety show had invited the renowned star Lise Nash to a dinner, which had quickly soured when she declined to partake in a toast.\n\nThis act of defiance had sparked a confrontation, only to be interrupted by Lise's domineering boyfriend. He stormed into the private dining room, dismissing the producer with a dismissive wave and escorting Lise away.\n\nThe tweet described the scene vividly, painting a picture of a powerful man defending his beloved partner.\n\nYet, perhaps due to his prominence, only the back of the man was visible in the accompanying photos, preserving his anonymity. Meanwhile, Lise, donning an oversized suit jacket, beamed a smile, reaching out to clasp his hand as they departed together.\n\nCarrie's eyes were glued to the screen, her stare intense and unblinking as she absorbed the image before her.\n\nThere he was--Kristopher Norris!\n\nThe suit jacket draped carelessly over Lise was a dead giveaway.\n\nEvery piece of clothing Kristopher owned had been meticulously tailored by a master craftsman abroad, a detail Carrie knew all too well.\n\nHer grip on her phone tightened, her knuckles blanching to a stark white, as if her very soul were being squeezed by an invisible hand, the pain sharp and acid-like in its intensity.\n\nIn her most desperate moment, Kristopher had coldly disconnected their call, choosing instead to be at Lise's side.\n\nWhat was the worth of their two-year marriage?\n\nThe tears she had been holding back now overwhelmed her, streaming down her face.\n\nEven as she tilted her head back in a futile attempt to stem the flow, the tears continued to escape.\n\nLise had always been Kristopher's first love, a fact whispered and gossiped about among their circles. The Norris family had never approved of Lise, seeing her ordinary background as unfitting.\n\nForced apart by family pressures, it had been Lise who ended things, but the past, it seemed, was not easily left behind.\n\nKristopher had diligently pursued the leadership of the Norris family, harboring dreams of finally being with Lise.\n\nYet, when he reached his goal, he discovered that Lise had already chosen another.\n\nIn defiance of his family's expectations and perhaps out of bitterness, Kristopher turned to Carrie, a woman equally devoid of wealth or status, to become Mrs. Norris, thereby blocking any matchmaking attempts by his relatives.\n\nAt that time, Carrie faced immense pressure from her father, Tristan Campbell, who was pushing her towards a marriage with a playboy, the son of a business associate, to cover her grandmother's steep medical expenses.\n\nBoth Kristopher and Carrie, driven by their personal motives, consented to a marriage of convenience.\n\nOriginally set for just one year, their contractual marriage stretched beyond its term, sustained by a shared understanding between them.\n\nOver time, Carrie began to believe in the authenticity of their union, never suspecting that it was merely an extension of her hopes.\n\nJust moments ago, a fire had nearly claimed Carrie's life. In that critical moment, she reached out to Kristopher, only to be twice rebuffed as he spent his time with Lise.\n\nThis harsh reality shattered Carrie's illusions, revealing that her perceived transition from pretense to genuine relationship was nothing but a facade maintained by her own desires.\n\nCarrie wasn't even a temporary substitute in Kristopher's life but merely a pawn used to spite his family.\n\nAfter a poignant pause, tears welled up in Carrie's eyes, unstoppable and poignant.\n\nIt might be time for her to release herself from the shackles of her own hopeful delusions--to stop deceiving herself.\n\nChapter 2 Trending Topics\nThe overwhelming number of injuries from the fire was staggering, straining the already frantic doctors and nurses as they tried to provide aid.\n\nCarrie had been merely grazed by a splintered clothes rack, which left a deep, jagged wound on her calf. In comparison to the chaos around her, her wounds seemed almost negligible.\n\nShe managed to get basic care--a brisk cleaning and a quick wrap of bandages--at a local hospital before catching a cab back to her house.\n\nBayview Villa, a grand property under Kristopher's name, was technically their matrimonial residence.\n\nLiving alone had become the norm for Carrie, as Kristopher was hardly ever around. She had bid farewell to the housekeeper, discovering that her life could be quite adequately maintained with just takeout, deliveries, and the occasional visit from a part-time cleaner.\n\nNow, she found herself the sole occupant of the sprawling living room, sinking into the sofa, her gaze drifting across the empty space.\n\nThe stark, monochrome decor did nothing to imbue warmth into the atmosphere.\n\nA chilling realization crept up on her: this vast, elegant space felt more like a colossal tomb, a silent grave for her lost years of youth and a love that had quietly slipped away.\n\nIn this cold, echoing house, would anyone even notice if her breath ceased one day?\n\nCarrie exhaled a weary sigh, her frame heavy as she leaned against the cold wall for support, struggling up the stairs to her bedroom on the second floor.\n\nEach step was a battle, sending stabbing pains shooting through her from the surface of her skin down to her aching bones.\n\nThe house, stark and hollow, echoed even the smallest sounds, magnifying her sense of isolation.\n\nIt was today, amidst this profound silence, that Carrie truly grasped the all-encompassing nature of her loneliness--it was almost tangible, enveloping her senses with its texture and mournful whispers, tightening around her heart like a vice, producing a dull, relentless ache.\n\nUpon reaching the sanctuary of her bedroom, she collapsed onto the bed, the very embodiment of exhaustion, feeling it both physically and spiritually.\n\nJust as she surrendered to this weariness, the sharp ring of the phone pierced the silence.\n\n\"You reached out to me earlier. What do you need?\" Kristopher's voice cut through the line, cold and distant as ever.\n\nCarrie was caught off guard by his unexpected call. Words failed her as she parted her lips to respond, but before she could collect her thoughts, a soft, feminine voice floated through from the other end. \"Kristopher, will you join me to...\"\n\nA surge of emotions tightened Carrie's grip on the phone, her heart thumping louder with each second. Overwhelmed and unable to contain her rising panic, she demanded, \"Who's there with you?\"\n\nKristopher gave no answer, merely stating in a flat, disinterested voice, \"If there's something you need, let's catch up when I'm back. I have pressing engagements right now, so I must disconnect.\"\n\nHe promptly ended the call, cutting off any chance for Carrie to reply.\n\nAs the harsh beep of the disconnected line filled her ears, Carrie's lips twisted into a rueful grin. How utterly foolish she felt! Deep down, she knew his response all too well, yet she had clung to the hope of hearing his voice confirm it.\n\nWith a sense of self-inflicted irony, Carrie activated her tablet and scrolled through the day's hot topics.\n\nOne headline caught her eye: \"A female star shielded from harassment at a dinner by her formidable partner.\" A wry smile twisted her lips.\n\nCarrie knew all too well what it was like to face harassment at those kinds of dinners.\n\nShe vividly remembered her first major audition after her entering the showbiz; her agent had escorted her to a dinner with the influential director and producer of the drama series \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nAs a novice in the dizzying world of showbiz, Carrie had felt incredibly vulnerable, uncertain of how to navigate the murky waters of such gatherings.\n\nThe producer had eyed her shamelessly, sneering as he asked, \"Is this the new talent you're introducing? She appears presentable, but I'm curious to see how she fares with a drink. Here's the deal, if you can gulp down this bottle in one go, I'll secure you an audition for the lead role.\"\n\nCarrie was inclined to decline, but under the relentless pressure from her agent, she found herself compelled to consume the entire bottle.\n\nAs the evening wore on, she was hurriedly taken to the hospital suffering from a severe stomach ailment.\n\nHer agent, fretful about the prospect of the role slipping away to another, quickly settled the hospital charges and departed.\n\nAt that time, Carrie found herself isolated in a hospital bed for several long days.\n\nYet, even before Carrie could be released from the hospital, the media was abuzz with the announcement that Lise had secured the lead role in \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nSubsequently, her agent rebuked Carrie for her lack of ambition, complaining, \"You are more appealing than Lise, so why can't you show more drive? She cozied up to Mr. Norris and hardly had to make an effort. She's surrounded by people eager to cater to her every need. I've heard that Mr. Norris personally orchestrated her landing the lead role in this production!\"\n\nWhen the show premiered, Lise was catapulted into stardom, swiftly ascending to the elite echelons of the acting world.\n\nFrom that moment forward, Carrie let her acting aspirations wane and chose instead to devote herself entirely to supporting her husband, Kristopher.\n\nAfter all, no matter her efforts, she could never get the same career opportunities that Lise seemed to receive effortlessly with Kristopher's offhand remarks.\n\nAt that time, Carrie had believed she was filling the role that was meant to be Lise's as Mrs. Norris, which meant she owed Lise.\n\nBy giving up the career opportunities to Lise, Carrie thought they would settle their unspoken debt.\n\nHowever, Carrie hadn't foreseen that Lise would claim both the coveted career and Kristopher's affections.\n\nAs Lise's professional and love life blossomed, Carrie came to the painful realization that she had been overly consumed with her romantic pursuits, at the expense of her career, and now, she found herself bereft of both love and professional fulfillment.\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Carrie viewed her past two years as tragically misguided.\n\nGiven another opportunity, she resolved she wouldn't be so unguarded, letting her heart recklessly fall captive to Kristopher's charm.\n\n\"Ms. Spencer, the new copyright contract is prepared. Please review it for any discrepancies.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed with the alert, snapping Carrie out of her reverie. She gazed at the PDF file attached in the message, her mind briefly overwhelmed.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Katrina Spencer, Carrie had once made a name for herself as a budding screenwriter, selling numerous scripts in her early days.\n\nDuring her early career as Katrina, Carrie often sold her work for a pittance, compelled by her urgent need for immediate cash.\n\nOver the years, these scripts transformed into blockbuster films and hit series, catapulting Katrina's reputation to new heights.\n\nBy this time, Carrie had married Kristopher and was no longer plagued by the financial woes that had once driven her to desperation--her grandmother's hefty medical bills were a thing of the past. With her financial crises resolved, Carrie's life had pivoted to domestic responsibilities, striving to be an exemplary wife to Kristopher. Amidst these changes, her pseudonym, Katrina Spencer, gradually receded into the background.\n\nHowever, her past as Katrina wasn't ready to be shelved just yet. Recently, an interested buyer had come forward, ready to pay a handsome sum for one of her old scripts.\n\nCarrie, however, was hesitant to sell. She raised several concerns about the contract presented to her, and to her astonishment, the buyer was genuine enough to revise it accordingly.\n\nHolding the revised contract in her hands, Carrie inhaled deeply, her resolve hardening. She seemed to have reached a crucial decision.\n\nHer fingers danced over her phone's keyboard with swift precision, typing out a firm command. \"Create a divorce agreement following my terms and ensure it reaches Kristopher Norris at the Norris Group.\"\n\nWithout pausing for a response, she placed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step echoing a blend of determination and newfound independence.\n\nChapter 3 Exchange Of Conveniences\nThirty minutes had passed, Carrie finally heaved herself up from the bathtub, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. As she lifted her gaze, her own image in the mirror halted her movements--her skin appeared as smooth and impeccable as fine porcelain, glowing with an unblemished radiance.\n\nHer eyes, deep pools of allure, sparkled with an enchanting, soft warmth, inviting anyone who dared meet her gaze.\n\nDespite edging into her late twenties at twenty-five, she reveled in the fact that time had yet to etch its marks upon her flawless complexion.\n\nSurely, a woman with such a visage had no place for self-pity.\n\nAbsorbed in her contemplation, Carrie carelessly extended her right leg onto the cold floor, forgetting it was the very limb she had injured. Wrapped excessively in cling film to shield it from moisture, the tight encasement had stifled her circulation, rendering her leg eerily numb. As her foot touched down, it betrayed her, slipping forward unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Carrie gasped, her arms flailing in a frantic ballet, searching for a lifeline in the void.\n\nJust as she teetered on the brink of a painful rendezvous with the floor, the bathroom door burst open.\n\nKristopher stood at the entrance, his suit immaculately tailored, creating a striking figure. As their eyes locked, he paused, visibly taken aback, then quickly closed the distance with brisk strides.\n\nCarrie's breath caught as Kristopher swept her up in a graceful bridal style, an unexpected tightness wrapping around her waist. Caught off guard by his sudden appearance, Carrie realized with a jolt that she was completely bare. A flush of embarrassment washed over her as she instinctively clutched her hands over her chest.\n\nThis was their first moment of such intimacy since their wedding, and the discomfort made her toes curl inward, her skin blushing a delicate shade of pink.\n\nKristopher looked down at her with a mischievous grin. \"Let's be honest, there's not much to see,\" he teased gently.\n\nFeeling both mortified and slightly irritated, Carrie snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Norris, after all you've seen, I suppose nothing can impress you anymore.\"\n\nShe carried her C-cup curves with understated charm, a touch of sensuality that outshone Lise's painfully flat, almost awkwardly rigid build.\n\nYet Carrie knew well that without love, even the most perfect physique paled in comparison to the charm of one dearly cherished.\n\nNonchalantly, Kristopher reached for a bathrobe hanging behind the door and draped it over her. His frown deepened at her comment. \"What are you talking about, Carrie?\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike him, and his expression grew even more impatient. \"Tell me, did you send those divorce papers in the dead of night just to lure me back here--to catch you completely bare?\" His tone was a mix of disbelief and annoyance. \"I told you I was swamped with work. Was this dramatic display really necessary?\"\n\nCarrie's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the tension between them. He was always so quick to lose patience with her.\n\nShe wasn't the type to throw around words like divorce or breakups lightly. In fact, this was the first time she'd ever mentioned divorce in their two-year marriage, yet he seemed indifferent to her turmoil. He simply dismissed her concerns as if she were overreacting about trivial matters.\n\nDespite the throbbing pain in her leg, Carrie mustered her strength and said, \"Put me down.\"\n\nKristopher, however, paid no heed, his eyes scanning her leg swathed in bandages. His brow furrowed slightly. \"What happened to your leg? Is this some elaborate ploy to lure me back?\"\n\nAt his words, a bitter laugh escaped Carrie.\n\nIt seemed he viewed her as merely seeking attention, and in failing to capture it, she had likely concocted a story to draw him back, allowing her to dramatize her plight in his presence.\n\nWith a blank face, she replied untruthfully, \"It's a beauty treatment that shouldn't get wet.\"\n\n\"Why did you suddenly decide to undergo such a treatment?\" Kristopher inquired, his tone casual as he carried her outside, not pressing the issue further.\n\nHis frame was large, and through his thin shirt, she could distinctly feel the warmth of his body and the defined shape of his chest muscles.\n\nThe closeness created an uncomfortable tension for Carrie, who had resolved to end things once and for all.\n\nHer voice climbed involuntarily, sharper this time. \"Oh, since when have you been concerned with such minor things, Mr. Norris?\"\n\nFor the first time, Kristopher witnessed her using biting sarcasm; it struck him as peculiarly amusing. With a calm demeanor, he responded, \"You're my wife, it's only natural I'd be concerned about your well-being.\"\n\n\"Really?\" There was a somber note in Carrie's voice now. \"It seems like you've never really regarded me as your wife. I'm scared that if I were to die, you wouldn't even know until much later.\"\n\nAfter all, at that very moment, Kristopher had been distracted, lost in moments with his first love, too consumed to lend an ear to her desperate pleas.\n\nCaught off guard by her accusation, Kristopher's eyes widened with surprise before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. \"Carrie, what's brought on this sudden outburst of anger? Just because I was tied up this afternoon and missed your call? Perhaps I've been too indulgent with you lately, and it's made you a bit too presumptuous?\"\n\nCarrie froze, startled. Was he accusing her of being too presumptuous?\n\nShe realized their marriage had always been lopsided. In his eyes, she was nothing more than a transactional partner, a woman who had bartered her freedom for financial security.\n\nTheir union was meant to be a mere exchange of conveniences, yet she had, quite foolishly, fallen deeply in love with him.\n\nIn the tricky terrain of romance, the one who fell first invariably found themselves at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nKristopher's dismissive reaction left Carrie reeling, her emotions dismissed as trifles, a tight knot of suffocation rising in her chest.\n\n\"I said to put me down this instant!\" Carrie exclaimed, jerking her head to the side, her voice laced with a sharp edge of impatience.\n\nKristopher remained mute, effortlessly carrying her towards the bed before suddenly releasing his hold.\n\nCarrie felt a jolt as the support vanished, her heart skipping a beat as she instinctively grasped for him.\n\nTheir bodies collided on the bed, her bathrobe teetering on the brink of decency, threatening to unravel with any minor shift.\n\nPropped on one elbow, Kristopher gazed down at her, his lips curled into a sly, teasing grin. \"You wanted to be let go, didn't you? So why cling to me now?\"\n\nHis eyes, deep and sparkling like a midnight lake speckled with stars, captivated her.\n\nIn those celestial depths, Carrie caught a glimpse of her own reflection.\n\nAt times like this, she was misled into believing he harbored a deep affection.\n\nSadly, his heart was a fortress reserved for Lise, and all Carrie had left were empty fantasies.\n\n\"Boring!\" she exclaimed, her voice devoid of any enthusiasm as she attempted to rise, her hand inadvertently brushing against something unexpected.\n\nThe following moment brought a noticeable shift in his cock pressing against her stomach.\n\n\"Don't move, or I can't promise what might happen next,\" he warned in a deep, gravelly voice.\n\nWith a frown, Carrie internally cursed upon hearing the statement.\n\nIt was an undeniable fact. Primal instincts steered the actions of men. Absence of affection didn't quell their basic desires.\n\nYet, she dared not agitate Kristopher. Angling her face away, her body remained rigid, frozen in place.\n\nCarrie, feeling irked, shot back. \"Didn't you say there's nothing here to see? What's with the reaction now, Mr. Norris? Are you really that easy to impress?\"\n\nNo sooner had her words flown than she grasped the potential repercussions of her sharp tongue.\n\nA wave of regret surged through Carrie, but instead of anger, Kristopher responded with a chuckle, \"You are my wife, after all. Since that's something I can't alter, I might as well embrace it. Besides, it's been years since we became husband and wife--it would be a shame to neglect you completely.\"\n\nChapter 4 Are You Out Of Your Mind?\nKristopher slipped his hand beneath the folds of her bathrobe, his touch tracing the curve of Carrie's skin, as smooth and delicate as silk. He encircled her slender waist, drawing her closer with a gentle yet firm grip.\n\nHer face, a captivating canvas of defiance and visible irritation, ignited in him an uncontrollable urge to claim victory over her resistance.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy, yet he remained composed, slowly removing his tailored suit.\n\nThe fabric of his suit brushed lightly against Carrie's cheek, releasing a mix of scents: a familiar woody aroma intertwined with an unexpected zesty twist of lemon. It was unmistakably Jo Malone's Blue Agava and Cacao--Lise's signature scent.\n\nA surge of nausea overwhelmed Carrie at the realization.\n\nAs Kristopher's eyes, now shaded with a stormy intensity, drew nearer to hers, the proximity conjured unwelcome visions of him with Lise. Her stomach churned violently, and with a sudden movement, she pushed him away, propping herself up with a jolt and a dry retch.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer stomach had been empty all day, leaving her with nothing to bring up.\n\nThe desire in Kristopher's gaze flickered out, replaced by a cold, detached expression as he withdrew slightly.\n\nObserving the genuine distress and the reddening of Carrie's eyes, Kristopher perceived her reaction for outright disgust at their closeness.\n\nHe paused, fingers adjusting his shirt cuffs, his voice cold as he confronted her. \"Carrie, is this reaction reserved only for me, or is it how you respond to all men?\"\n\nThe air in the room turned frosty, thick with tension.\n\nCarrie swallowed the sharp sting in her throat, her eyes widening in shock as she stared up at him.\n\nEver since their marriage, she had cut ties with nearly all her male friends, yet here was Kristopher, casually tossing out comments sharp enough to cut glass.\n\nThe years of love she had poured into their relationship now seemed utterly futile.\n\nHeat crept up her neck, coloring her cheeks a bright scarlet as indignation took hold. Without thinking, her hand flew up and delivered a stinging slap across Kristopher's face.\n\nAll her suppressed grievances from the day ignited in that swift motion.\n\nHer bathrobe, loosened in the heat of the moment, slipped from her shoulders. Ignoring the flush of exposure, she swiftly gathered the fabric and draped it around herself, her movements quick and firm.\n\nThe impact of her slap had left a light, crimson mark on Kristopher's cheek, marking him with her outrage.\n\nHis eyes, wide with disbelief, met hers. \"Carrie, are you out of your mind?\"\n\nOut of her mind? Yes, she was clearly insane to ever fall for him in the first place.\n\nCarrie fumed silently, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nSuddenly, the sharp buzz of the phone on the table cut through the mounting tension, its vibration bringing a brief respite from their standoff.\n\nKristopher cast a fleeting glance at the message, shut off the phone with a snap, and strode towards the door, his back rigid with tension.\n\nHer voice, firm and unwavering, chased after him. \"We're getting a divorce! Make sure you sign those papers before you walk out that door!\"\n\nKristopher paused briefly and said sharply, \"I have something to do now. When I return, do whatever pleases you.\" With that, he forcefully shut the door.\n\nCarrie's eyes followed his unwavering exit, feeling an oppressive weight compressing her chest once again.\n\nShe disregarded the sharp sting in her leg and hobbled determinedly toward her tablet. Fingers trembling, she hastily navigated to Lise's Twitter page.\n\nLise had just uploaded a new tweet.\n\nThe photo showed her lying down with a fever patch adhered to her forehead, still enveloped in Kristopher's familiar jacket.\n\nThe caption read, \"Being sick makes me extra clingy. Wishing I had someone here. Stay cozy and take care, everyone!\"\n\nThe simultaneous timing of these two events made it almost impossible for Carrie not to suspect that Kristopher had dashed off to tend to Lise.\n\nCarrie's instincts loudly proclaimed that this was no accident; Lise had deliberately sought to tug at Kristopher's heartstrings. It appeared her tactics were effective.\n\nNot even Carrie's stark threat of divorce could overshadow Lise's theatrical display of vulnerability.\n\nSeething with fury, Carrie quaked like a leaf swept into a storm.\n\nShe steeled herself against the heartache, forcefully ripping the plastic wrap from her aching leg.\n\nAfter her lengthy soak, the bath's lingering moisture had infiltrated her skin, inflaming the wound until it was a vivid, angry red and painfully swollen.\n\nShe, too, could be clingy. Even in the harshest times back in the county, she had shown vulnerability, breaking down into soft sobs within the comforting arms of her grandmother, especially that one time she got burned by the scalding kettle.\n\nBut such vulnerability had its time and place, and it wasn't now.\n\nThe stark reality of Kristopher's exit forced Carrie to confront her need for self-reliance.\n\nBiting down hard on her lip, Carrie cleaned the throbbing wound with a practiced hand before securely wrapping it anew.\n\nShe rose with a newfound resolve and yanked a black suitcase from the far end of her expansive walk-in closet--it held all the belongings she'd brought into this house as a hopeful bride.\n\nShe grabbed a fresh set of clothes to slip into and left a bank card neatly on the bedside table.\n\nShe had transferred every penny she'd earned over the past year onto that card, effectively settling her financial entanglements with Kristopher over the last two years and cutting him out of her life for good.\n\nDragging the heavy suitcase behind her, she limped painfully out of the opulent villa.\n\nAs she passed through the gate, she wrapped her baseball jacket more tightly around her slight figure, her silhouette hauntingly solitary in the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe night air of early spring was bitingly cold, devoid of any trace of warmth, a chill that seemed almost faint compared to the ice forming in Carrie's shattered heart.\n\nShe had arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a heart full of dreams, and now she was leaving, dreams crumbled, utterly alone.\n\nA bitter laugh slipped through her lips. If only she hadn't fallen so hard for him, if only she'd proposed an amicable separation at the end of their agreed year, maybe she wouldn't be wandering now, a lost soul in the shadow of her former self.\n\nLise didn't have to lift a finger, and Carrie had already fallen, utterly broken and beyond redemption.\n\nChapter 5 A Gathering\nMeanwhile, in the Oasis Club, renowned as the priciest spot in Orkset, the air within the VIP room crackled with excitement. Under the spell of bright lights and thumping music, a diverse group of men and women lounged together, basking in the exclusivity of the setting.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, revealing Kristopher in the doorway.\n\nThe karaoke session halted abruptly as the crowd turned to greet him in unison, voices mingling. \"Kristopher...\"\n\nBefore they could utter another word, a woman cloaked from head to toe stepped out from behind him.\n\nLise, with a fluid motion, removed her mask and slid her arm through Kristopher's. She addressed the room with a poised charm. \"My assistant took a sudden leave, and I found myself without company. Not keen on spending the evening alone, I invited Kristopher to join me. I trust that's alright?\"\n\nLise's beauty was without question. Her face was a delicate composition of cherry lips and a sculpted nose, framed by eyes that shimmered with a vulnerable allure, commanding a protective fervor from those around her--her presence, ethereal.\n\nIn contrast, Carrie's features were more pronounced, her beauty vivid and striking. Lise, by comparison, carried a softer, more understated elegance.\n\nYet, as it often goes, matters of the heart followed no simple paths.\n\nWhile Kristopher and Carrie were married, it was in name only; Kristopher seemed detached and seldom included her in private social events.\n\nThe group didn't have much of a relationship with Carrie, leading them to feel no obligation to defend her.\n\nUpon hearing Lise's comment, a moment of discomfort rippled through the air. Nonetheless, they quickly recovered, offering a congenial smile as they said, \"We're all friends here; let's not bother with formalities.\"\n\nLise offered a subtle, knowing smile, as she gracefully accompanied Kristopher into the bustling room.\n\nThe event that evening had been meticulously planned to express appreciation for Kristopher's contributions.\n\nAs they stepped into the room, the crowd parted like the sea, making way for them to proceed to the seats of honor.\n\nThe group's leader handed Kristopher a glass of wine with a flourish, proclaiming with a broad grin, \"We truly owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Norris! Your exceptional talents are the talk of the town, and witnessing them firsthand today only confirms it. Without your expertise, securing this contract would have been a fantasy!\"\n\nTheir gathering marked the launch of a novel shopping platform, one that had been in negotiation with numerous local brands in Orkset. But the scenario changed dramatically when the tech giant JoyBuy dramatically entered the scene, stirring up the competitive landscape.\n\nCompeting with JoyBuy was akin to the classic David versus Goliath tale--hopelessly daunting. In a surge of desperation, they turned to Kristopher, reaching out through a network of connections for his renowned strategic prowess.\n\nWith his characteristic swiftness, Kristopher hatched an ingenious plan and swiftly secured the deal, snatching it from the clutches of JoyBuy right before the business association could ink their agreement--a masterful coup that reverberated success.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround only intensified the already deep respect everyone held for Kristopher.\n\nAlbin Murray, beaming with pride, couldn't help but boast, \"Ah, just look at the caliber of his friends! They thought they could steal deals right under our noses, obviously underestimating Kristopher's clout!\"\n\nAlbin, born into the wealthy Murray family, counted himself among Kristopher's closest friends. He was renowned for his sprawling social web--a network through which the desperate plea for help was channeled to Kristopher.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristopher himself, the focus of all their discussions, reclined nonchalantly on the couch, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe was well-versed in the art of receiving compliments; thus, his expression stayed calm and detached.\n\nThe ambient light sculpted his angular features, casting dramatic shadows that emphasized his high nose bridge and sharply cut jawline, as though he were a living masterpiece.\n\nHis natural grace and detachment eclipsed any terrestrial magnificence.\n\nFollowing a sequence of celebratory toasts, when it became apparent that Kristopher merely touched his glass without truly drinking, the rest of the company toned down their conversation, allowing him a moment of repose with his eyes gently shut.\n\nLise, slightly feverish, opted not to indulge in the spirits, choosing instead to sit in serene silence next to Kristopher, her eyes lingering on him with a look of deep, unmistakable adoration.\n\nAlbin, captivated by the seemingly perfect pair, pondered the whims of destiny. He discreetly captured their image with his smartphone and nonchalantly shared it across his social networks.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the liquor dwindled, the room's door swung open anew.\n\nKristopher's personal assistant, Oliver Brooks, made his entrance, acknowledging the gathering with a courteous nod that bordered on respect but avoided groveling, swiftly positioning himself in front of Kristopher.\n\nSilence hung in the air, yet Lise, unable to contain her curiosity, leaned in and whispered, \"What's going on?\"\n\nOliver, maintaining his focus on Kristopher, chose not to respond directly to her.\n\nA flush of embarrassment tinted Lise's cheeks as she turned towards Kristopher, hesitatingly inquiring, \"Should I leave?\"\n\nKristopher adjusted his posture, his voice low and calm as he instructed, \"Go ahead, speak.\"\n\nA shiver of apprehension coursed through Oliver as he tentatively began, \"Mr. Norris, Mrs. Norris has departed from Bayview Villa, and...\"\n\n&9&\n0:00 / 4:50",

        "primary_text": "\"He finally remembered the woman waiting for him at home, only to face her divorce papers. Confident she'd regret it, he signed. But post-divorce, she blossomed, turning heads everywhere. Defeated, he begged to win her back!\n=====\nIn the bustling, weathered heart of Orkset, flames erupted violently within an ancient apartment building. Propelled by gusts of wind, the fire devoured the structure, belching dense smoke and bright, searing tongues of flame.\n\n\"Saved! They've been saved.\" The words echoed amidst the chaos.\n\nFirefighters emerged from the smoldering inferno, carrying Carrie Campbell to safety at the roadside.\n\nHer features, usually refined and expressive, were now smeared with soot; her sparkling eyes dimmed to a vacant gaze, hollow and lost.\n\nAs reality seeped back into her consciousness, Carrie felt a rush of gratitude overpower her usual composure. Her voice, hoarse and weak, conveyed a profound \"thank you\" to her rescuers. Shaking, she fumbled for her phone, her fingertips quivering as they found the familiar number.\n\n\"Hello, the person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe automated message played after a few rings, leaving her with a lump in her throat, her unvoiced frustrations and sorrow welling up inside her.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a deafening roar, the explosion abruptly silenced the cold, mechanical voice echoing through the line. Carrie's head snapped upwards, shock painted on her face as she witnessed the apartment she had just exited erupt into flames.\n\nChunks of debris were hurled into the air by the force of the blast, scattering across the sky.\n\nPanic engulfed the crowd as survivors, freshly rescued, screamed in terror. They huddled together, seeking solace in each other's arms, their cries piercing the tumultuous scene. In stark contrast, Carrie lay alone on a stretcher, her isolation magnified amidst the chaos.\n\n\"Kristopher...\" Fighting the dread creeping up her spine, Carrie pressed her lips together tightly and dialed her husband's number again, her resolve unwavering.\n\nYet, the call disconnected after a few short rings, leaving her with a haunting silence.\n\nJust then, a Twitter notification flickered on her phone screen.\n\nThe gossip feed was alive with the latest gossip: #LiseNash #MysteriouBoyfriend.\n\nAccording to the tweet, a producer from a well-known variety show had invited the renowned star Lise Nash to a dinner, which had quickly soured when she declined to partake in a toast.\n\nThis act of defiance had sparked a confrontation, only to be interrupted by Lise's domineering boyfriend. He stormed into the private dining room, dismissing the producer with a dismissive wave and escorting Lise away.\n\nThe tweet described the scene vividly, painting a picture of a powerful man defending his beloved partner.\n\nYet, perhaps due to his prominence, only the back of the man was visible in the accompanying photos, preserving his anonymity. Meanwhile, Lise, donning an oversized suit jacket, beamed a smile, reaching out to clasp his hand as they departed together.\n\nCarrie's eyes were glued to the screen, her stare intense and unblinking as she absorbed the image before her.\n\nThere he was--Kristopher Norris!\n\nThe suit jacket draped carelessly over Lise was a dead giveaway.\n\nEvery piece of clothing Kristopher owned had been meticulously tailored by a master craftsman abroad, a detail Carrie knew all too well.\n\nHer grip on her phone tightened, her knuckles blanching to a stark white, as if her very soul were being squeezed by an invisible hand, the pain sharp and acid-like in its intensity.\n\nIn her most desperate moment, Kristopher had coldly disconnected their call, choosing instead to be at Lise's side.\n\nWhat was the worth of their two-year marriage?\n\nThe tears she had been holding back now overwhelmed her, streaming down her face.\n\nEven as she tilted her head back in a futile attempt to stem the flow, the tears continued to escape.\n\nLise had always been Kristopher's first love, a fact whispered and gossiped about among their circles. The Norris family had never approved of Lise, seeing her ordinary background as unfitting.\n\nForced apart by family pressures, it had been Lise who ended things, but the past, it seemed, was not easily left behind.\n\nKristopher had diligently pursued the leadership of the Norris family, harboring dreams of finally being with Lise.\n\nYet, when he reached his goal, he discovered that Lise had already chosen another.\n\nIn defiance of his family's expectations and perhaps out of bitterness, Kristopher turned to Carrie, a woman equally devoid of wealth or status, to become Mrs. Norris, thereby blocking any matchmaking attempts by his relatives.\n\nAt that time, Carrie faced immense pressure from her father, Tristan Campbell, who was pushing her towards a marriage with a playboy, the son of a business associate, to cover her grandmother's steep medical expenses.\n\nBoth Kristopher and Carrie, driven by their personal motives, consented to a marriage of convenience.\n\nOriginally set for just one year, their contractual marriage stretched beyond its term, sustained by a shared understanding between them.\n\nOver time, Carrie began to believe in the authenticity of their union, never suspecting that it was merely an extension of her hopes.\n\nJust moments ago, a fire had nearly claimed Carrie's life. In that critical moment, she reached out to Kristopher, only to be twice rebuffed as he spent his time with Lise.\n\nThis harsh reality shattered Carrie's illusions, revealing that her perceived transition from pretense to genuine relationship was nothing but a facade maintained by her own desires.\n\nCarrie wasn't even a temporary substitute in Kristopher's life but merely a pawn used to spite his family.\n\nAfter a poignant pause, tears welled up in Carrie's eyes, unstoppable and poignant.\n\nIt might be time for her to release herself from the shackles of her own hopeful delusions--to stop deceiving herself.\n\nChapter 2 Trending Topics\nThe overwhelming number of injuries from the fire was staggering, straining the already frantic doctors and nurses as they tried to provide aid.\n\nCarrie had been merely grazed by a splintered clothes rack, which left a deep, jagged wound on her calf. In comparison to the chaos around her, her wounds seemed almost negligible.\n\nShe managed to get basic care--a brisk cleaning and a quick wrap of bandages--at a local hospital before catching a cab back to her house.\n\nBayview Villa, a grand property under Kristopher's name, was technically their matrimonial residence.\n\nLiving alone had become the norm for Carrie, as Kristopher was hardly ever around. She had bid farewell to the housekeeper, discovering that her life could be quite adequately maintained with just takeout, deliveries, and the occasional visit from a part-time cleaner.\n\nNow, she found herself the sole occupant of the sprawling living room, sinking into the sofa, her gaze drifting across the empty space.\n\nThe stark, monochrome decor did nothing to imbue warmth into the atmosphere.\n\nA chilling realization crept up on her: this vast, elegant space felt more like a colossal tomb, a silent grave for her lost years of youth and a love that had quietly slipped away.\n\nIn this cold, echoing house, would anyone even notice if her breath ceased one day?\n\nCarrie exhaled a weary sigh, her frame heavy as she leaned against the cold wall for support, struggling up the stairs to her bedroom on the second floor.\n\nEach step was a battle, sending stabbing pains shooting through her from the surface of her skin down to her aching bones.\n\nThe house, stark and hollow, echoed even the smallest sounds, magnifying her sense of isolation.\n\nIt was today, amidst this profound silence, that Carrie truly grasped the all-encompassing nature of her loneliness--it was almost tangible, enveloping her senses with its texture and mournful whispers, tightening around her heart like a vice, producing a dull, relentless ache.\n\nUpon reaching the sanctuary of her bedroom, she collapsed onto the bed, the very embodiment of exhaustion, feeling it both physically and spiritually.\n\nJust as she surrendered to this weariness, the sharp ring of the phone pierced the silence.\n\n\"You reached out to me earlier. What do you need?\" Kristopher's voice cut through the line, cold and distant as ever.\n\nCarrie was caught off guard by his unexpected call. Words failed her as she parted her lips to respond, but before she could collect her thoughts, a soft, feminine voice floated through from the other end. \"Kristopher, will you join me to...\"\n\nA surge of emotions tightened Carrie's grip on the phone, her heart thumping louder with each second. Overwhelmed and unable to contain her rising panic, she demanded, \"Who's there with you?\"\n\nKristopher gave no answer, merely stating in a flat, disinterested voice, \"If there's something you need, let's catch up when I'm back. I have pressing engagements right now, so I must disconnect.\"\n\nHe promptly ended the call, cutting off any chance for Carrie to reply.\n\nAs the harsh beep of the disconnected line filled her ears, Carrie's lips twisted into a rueful grin. How utterly foolish she felt! Deep down, she knew his response all too well, yet she had clung to the hope of hearing his voice confirm it.\n\nWith a sense of self-inflicted irony, Carrie activated her tablet and scrolled through the day's hot topics.\n\nOne headline caught her eye: \"A female star shielded from harassment at a dinner by her formidable partner.\" A wry smile twisted her lips.\n\nCarrie knew all too well what it was like to face harassment at those kinds of dinners.\n\nShe vividly remembered her first major audition after her entering the showbiz; her agent had escorted her to a dinner with the influential director and producer of the drama series \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nAs a novice in the dizzying world of showbiz, Carrie had felt incredibly vulnerable, uncertain of how to navigate the murky waters of such gatherings.\n\nThe producer had eyed her shamelessly, sneering as he asked, \"Is this the new talent you're introducing? She appears presentable, but I'm curious to see how she fares with a drink. Here's the deal, if you can gulp down this bottle in one go, I'll secure you an audition for the lead role.\"\n\nCarrie was inclined to decline, but under the relentless pressure from her agent, she found herself compelled to consume the entire bottle.\n\nAs the evening wore on, she was hurriedly taken to the hospital suffering from a severe stomach ailment.\n\nHer agent, fretful about the prospect of the role slipping away to another, quickly settled the hospital charges and departed.\n\nAt that time, Carrie found herself isolated in a hospital bed for several long days.\n\nYet, even before Carrie could be released from the hospital, the media was abuzz with the announcement that Lise had secured the lead role in \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nSubsequently, her agent rebuked Carrie for her lack of ambition, complaining, \"You are more appealing than Lise, so why can't you show more drive? She cozied up to Mr. Norris and hardly had to make an effort. She's surrounded by people eager to cater to her every need. I've heard that Mr. Norris personally orchestrated her landing the lead role in this production!\"\n\nWhen the show premiered, Lise was catapulted into stardom, swiftly ascending to the elite echelons of the acting world.\n\nFrom that moment forward, Carrie let her acting aspirations wane and chose instead to devote herself entirely to supporting her husband, Kristopher.\n\nAfter all, no matter her efforts, she could never get the same career opportunities that Lise seemed to receive effortlessly with Kristopher's offhand remarks.\n\nAt that time, Carrie had believed she was filling the role that was meant to be Lise's as Mrs. Norris, which meant she owed Lise.\n\nBy giving up the career opportunities to Lise, Carrie thought they would settle their unspoken debt.\n\nHowever, Carrie hadn't foreseen that Lise would claim both the coveted career and Kristopher's affections.\n\nAs Lise's professional and love life blossomed, Carrie came to the painful realization that she had been overly consumed with her romantic pursuits, at the expense of her career, and now, she found herself bereft of both love and professional fulfillment.\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Carrie viewed her past two years as tragically misguided.\n\nGiven another opportunity, she resolved she wouldn't be so unguarded, letting her heart recklessly fall captive to Kristopher's charm.\n\n\"Ms. Spencer, the new copyright contract is prepared. Please review it for any discrepancies.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed with the alert, snapping Carrie out of her reverie. She gazed at the PDF file attached in the message, her mind briefly overwhelmed.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Katrina Spencer, Carrie had once made a name for herself as a budding screenwriter, selling numerous scripts in her early days.\n\nDuring her early career as Katrina, Carrie often sold her work for a pittance, compelled by her urgent need for immediate cash.\n\nOver the years, these scripts transformed into blockbuster films and hit series, catapulting Katrina's reputation to new heights.\n\nBy this time, Carrie had married Kristopher and was no longer plagued by the financial woes that had once driven her to desperation--her grandmother's hefty medical bills were a thing of the past. With her financial crises resolved, Carrie's life had pivoted to domestic responsibilities, striving to be an exemplary wife to Kristopher. Amidst these changes, her pseudonym, Katrina Spencer, gradually receded into the background.\n\nHowever, her past as Katrina wasn't ready to be shelved just yet. Recently, an interested buyer had come forward, ready to pay a handsome sum for one of her old scripts.\n\nCarrie, however, was hesitant to sell. She raised several concerns about the contract presented to her, and to her astonishment, the buyer was genuine enough to revise it accordingly.\n\nHolding the revised contract in her hands, Carrie inhaled deeply, her resolve hardening. She seemed to have reached a crucial decision.\n\nHer fingers danced over her phone's keyboard with swift precision, typing out a firm command. \"Create a divorce agreement following my terms and ensure it reaches Kristopher Norris at the Norris Group.\"\n\nWithout pausing for a response, she placed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step echoing a blend of determination and newfound independence.\n\nChapter 3 Exchange Of Conveniences\nThirty minutes had passed, Carrie finally heaved herself up from the bathtub, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. As she lifted her gaze, her own image in the mirror halted her movements--her skin appeared as smooth and impeccable as fine porcelain, glowing with an unblemished radiance.\n\nHer eyes, deep pools of allure, sparkled with an enchanting, soft warmth, inviting anyone who dared meet her gaze.\n\nDespite edging into her late twenties at twenty-five, she reveled in the fact that time had yet to etch its marks upon her flawless complexion.\n\nSurely, a woman with such a visage had no place for self-pity.\n\nAbsorbed in her contemplation, Carrie carelessly extended her right leg onto the cold floor, forgetting it was the very limb she had injured. Wrapped excessively in cling film to shield it from moisture, the tight encasement had stifled her circulation, rendering her leg eerily numb. As her foot touched down, it betrayed her, slipping forward unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Carrie gasped, her arms flailing in a frantic ballet, searching for a lifeline in the void.\n\nJust as she teetered on the brink of a painful rendezvous with the floor, the bathroom door burst open.\n\nKristopher stood at the entrance, his suit immaculately tailored, creating a striking figure. As their eyes locked, he paused, visibly taken aback, then quickly closed the distance with brisk strides.\n\nCarrie's breath caught as Kristopher swept her up in a graceful bridal style, an unexpected tightness wrapping around her waist. Caught off guard by his sudden appearance, Carrie realized with a jolt that she was completely bare. A flush of embarrassment washed over her as she instinctively clutched her hands over her chest.\n\nThis was their first moment of such intimacy since their wedding, and the discomfort made her toes curl inward, her skin blushing a delicate shade of pink.\n\nKristopher looked down at her with a mischievous grin. \"Let's be honest, there's not much to see,\" he teased gently.\n\nFeeling both mortified and slightly irritated, Carrie snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Norris, after all you've seen, I suppose nothing can impress you anymore.\"\n\nShe carried her C-cup curves with understated charm, a touch of sensuality that outshone Lise's painfully flat, almost awkwardly rigid build.\n\nYet Carrie knew well that without love, even the most perfect physique paled in comparison to the charm of one dearly cherished.\n\nNonchalantly, Kristopher reached for a bathrobe hanging behind the door and draped it over her. His frown deepened at her comment. \"What are you talking about, Carrie?\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike him, and his expression grew even more impatient. \"Tell me, did you send those divorce papers in the dead of night just to lure me back here--to catch you completely bare?\" His tone was a mix of disbelief and annoyance. \"I told you I was swamped with work. Was this dramatic display really necessary?\"\n\nCarrie's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the tension between them. He was always so quick to lose patience with her.\n\nShe wasn't the type to throw around words like divorce or breakups lightly. In fact, this was the first time she'd ever mentioned divorce in their two-year marriage, yet he seemed indifferent to her turmoil. He simply dismissed her concerns as if she were overreacting about trivial matters.\n\nDespite the throbbing pain in her leg, Carrie mustered her strength and said, \"Put me down.\"\n\nKristopher, however, paid no heed, his eyes scanning her leg swathed in bandages. His brow furrowed slightly. \"What happened to your leg? Is this some elaborate ploy to lure me back?\"\n\nAt his words, a bitter laugh escaped Carrie.\n\nIt seemed he viewed her as merely seeking attention, and in failing to capture it, she had likely concocted a story to draw him back, allowing her to dramatize her plight in his presence.\n\nWith a blank face, she replied untruthfully, \"It's a beauty treatment that shouldn't get wet.\"\n\n\"Why did you suddenly decide to undergo such a treatment?\" Kristopher inquired, his tone casual as he carried her outside, not pressing the issue further.\n\nHis frame was large, and through his thin shirt, she could distinctly feel the warmth of his body and the defined shape of his chest muscles.\n\nThe closeness created an uncomfortable tension for Carrie, who had resolved to end things once and for all.\n\nHer voice climbed involuntarily, sharper this time. \"Oh, since when have you been concerned with such minor things, Mr. Norris?\"\n\nFor the first time, Kristopher witnessed her using biting sarcasm; it struck him as peculiarly amusing. With a calm demeanor, he responded, \"You're my wife, it's only natural I'd be concerned about your well-being.\"\n\n\"Really?\" There was a somber note in Carrie's voice now. \"It seems like you've never really regarded me as your wife. I'm scared that if I were to die, you wouldn't even know until much later.\"\n\nAfter all, at that very moment, Kristopher had been distracted, lost in moments with his first love, too consumed to lend an ear to her desperate pleas.\n\nCaught off guard by her accusation, Kristopher's eyes widened with surprise before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. \"Carrie, what's brought on this sudden outburst of anger? Just because I was tied up this afternoon and missed your call? Perhaps I've been too indulgent with you lately, and it's made you a bit too presumptuous?\"\n\nCarrie froze, startled. Was he accusing her of being too presumptuous?\n\nShe realized their marriage had always been lopsided. In his eyes, she was nothing more than a transactional partner, a woman who had bartered her freedom for financial security.\n\nTheir union was meant to be a mere exchange of conveniences, yet she had, quite foolishly, fallen deeply in love with him.\n\nIn the tricky terrain of romance, the one who fell first invariably found themselves at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nKristopher's dismissive reaction left Carrie reeling, her emotions dismissed as trifles, a tight knot of suffocation rising in her chest.\n\n\"I said to put me down this instant!\" Carrie exclaimed, jerking her head to the side, her voice laced with a sharp edge of impatience.\n\nKristopher remained mute, effortlessly carrying her towards the bed before suddenly releasing his hold.\n\nCarrie felt a jolt as the support vanished, her heart skipping a beat as she instinctively grasped for him.\n\nTheir bodies collided on the bed, her bathrobe teetering on the brink of decency, threatening to unravel with any minor shift.\n\nPropped on one elbow, Kristopher gazed down at her, his lips curled into a sly, teasing grin. \"You wanted to be let go, didn't you? So why cling to me now?\"\n\nHis eyes, deep and sparkling like a midnight lake speckled with stars, captivated her.\n\nIn those celestial depths, Carrie caught a glimpse of her own reflection.\n\nAt times like this, she was misled into believing he harbored a deep affection.\n\nSadly, his heart was a fortress reserved for Lise, and all Carrie had left were empty fantasies.\n\n\"Boring!\" she exclaimed, her voice devoid of any enthusiasm as she attempted to rise, her hand inadvertently brushing against something unexpected.\n\nThe following moment brought a noticeable shift in his cock pressing against her stomach.\n\n\"Don't move, or I can't promise what might happen next,\" he warned in a deep, gravelly voice.\n\nWith a frown, Carrie internally cursed upon hearing the statement.\n\nIt was an undeniable fact. Primal instincts steered the actions of men. Absence of affection didn't quell their basic desires.\n\nYet, she dared not agitate Kristopher. Angling her face away, her body remained rigid, frozen in place.\n\nCarrie, feeling irked, shot back. \"Didn't you say there's nothing here to see? What's with the reaction now, Mr. Norris? Are you really that easy to impress?\"\n\nNo sooner had her words flown than she grasped the potential repercussions of her sharp tongue.\n\nA wave of regret surged through Carrie, but instead of anger, Kristopher responded with a chuckle, \"You are my wife, after all. Since that's something I can't alter, I might as well embrace it. Besides, it's been years since we became husband and wife--it would be a shame to neglect you completely.\"\n\nChapter 4 Are You Out Of Your Mind?\nKristopher slipped his hand beneath the folds of her bathrobe, his touch tracing the curve of Carrie's skin, as smooth and delicate as silk. He encircled her slender waist, drawing her closer with a gentle yet firm grip.\n\nHer face, a captivating canvas of defiance and visible irritation, ignited in him an uncontrollable urge to claim victory over her resistance.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy, yet he remained composed, slowly removing his tailored suit.\n\nThe fabric of his suit brushed lightly against Carrie's cheek, releasing a mix of scents: a familiar woody aroma intertwined with an unexpected zesty twist of lemon. It was unmistakably Jo Malone's Blue Agava and Cacao--Lise's signature scent.\n\nA surge of nausea overwhelmed Carrie at the realization.\n\nAs Kristopher's eyes, now shaded with a stormy intensity, drew nearer to hers, the proximity conjured unwelcome visions of him with Lise. Her stomach churned violently, and with a sudden movement, she pushed him away, propping herself up with a jolt and a dry retch.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer stomach had been empty all day, leaving her with nothing to bring up.\n\nThe desire in Kristopher's gaze flickered out, replaced by a cold, detached expression as he withdrew slightly.\n\nObserving the genuine distress and the reddening of Carrie's eyes, Kristopher perceived her reaction for outright disgust at their closeness.\n\nHe paused, fingers adjusting his shirt cuffs, his voice cold as he confronted her. \"Carrie, is this reaction reserved only for me, or is it how you respond to all men?\"\n\nThe air in the room turned frosty, thick with tension.\n\nCarrie swallowed the sharp sting in her throat, her eyes widening in shock as she stared up at him.\n\nEver since their marriage, she had cut ties with nearly all her male friends, yet here was Kristopher, casually tossing out comments sharp enough to cut glass.\n\nThe years of love she had poured into their relationship now seemed utterly futile.\n\nHeat crept up her neck, coloring her cheeks a bright scarlet as indignation took hold. Without thinking, her hand flew up and delivered a stinging slap across Kristopher's face.\n\nAll her suppressed grievances from the day ignited in that swift motion.\n\nHer bathrobe, loosened in the heat of the moment, slipped from her shoulders. Ignoring the flush of exposure, she swiftly gathered the fabric and draped it around herself, her movements quick and firm.\n\nThe impact of her slap had left a light, crimson mark on Kristopher's cheek, marking him with her outrage.\n\nHis eyes, wide with disbelief, met hers. \"Carrie, are you out of your mind?\"\n\nOut of her mind? Yes, she was clearly insane to ever fall for him in the first place.\n\nCarrie fumed silently, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nSuddenly, the sharp buzz of the phone on the table cut through the mounting tension, its vibration bringing a brief respite from their standoff.\n\nKristopher cast a fleeting glance at the message, shut off the phone with a snap, and strode towards the door, his back rigid with tension.\n\nHer voice, firm and unwavering, chased after him. \"We're getting a divorce! Make sure you sign those papers before you walk out that door!\"\n\nKristopher paused briefly and said sharply, \"I have something to do now. When I return, do whatever pleases you.\" With that, he forcefully shut the door.\n\nCarrie's eyes followed his unwavering exit, feeling an oppressive weight compressing her chest once again.\n\nShe disregarded the sharp sting in her leg and hobbled determinedly toward her tablet. Fingers trembling, she hastily navigated to Lise's Twitter page.\n\nLise had just uploaded a new tweet.\n\nThe photo showed her lying down with a fever patch adhered to her forehead, still enveloped in Kristopher's familiar jacket.\n\nThe caption read, \"Being sick makes me extra clingy. Wishing I had someone here. Stay cozy and take care, everyone!\"\n\nThe simultaneous timing of these two events made it almost impossible for Carrie not to suspect that Kristopher had dashed off to tend to Lise.\n\nCarrie's instincts loudly proclaimed that this was no accident; Lise had deliberately sought to tug at Kristopher's heartstrings. It appeared her tactics were effective.\n\nNot even Carrie's stark threat of divorce could overshadow Lise's theatrical display of vulnerability.\n\nSeething with fury, Carrie quaked like a leaf swept into a storm.\n\nShe steeled herself against the heartache, forcefully ripping the plastic wrap from her aching leg.\n\nAfter her lengthy soak, the bath's lingering moisture had infiltrated her skin, inflaming the wound until it was a vivid, angry red and painfully swollen.\n\nShe, too, could be clingy. Even in the harshest times back in the county, she had shown vulnerability, breaking down into soft sobs within the comforting arms of her grandmother, especially that one time she got burned by the scalding kettle.\n\nBut such vulnerability had its time and place, and it wasn't now.\n\nThe stark reality of Kristopher's exit forced Carrie to confront her need for self-reliance.\n\nBiting down hard on her lip, Carrie cleaned the throbbing wound with a practiced hand before securely wrapping it anew.\n\nShe rose with a newfound resolve and yanked a black suitcase from the far end of her expansive walk-in closet--it held all the belongings she'd brought into this house as a hopeful bride.\n\nShe grabbed a fresh set of clothes to slip into and left a bank card neatly on the bedside table.\n\nShe had transferred every penny she'd earned over the past year onto that card, effectively settling her financial entanglements with Kristopher over the last two years and cutting him out of her life for good.\n\nDragging the heavy suitcase behind her, she limped painfully out of the opulent villa.\n\nAs she passed through the gate, she wrapped her baseball jacket more tightly around her slight figure, her silhouette hauntingly solitary in the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe night air of early spring was bitingly cold, devoid of any trace of warmth, a chill that seemed almost faint compared to the ice forming in Carrie's shattered heart.\n\nShe had arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a heart full of dreams, and now she was leaving, dreams crumbled, utterly alone.\n\nA bitter laugh slipped through her lips. If only she hadn't fallen so hard for him, if only she'd proposed an amicable separation at the end of their agreed year, maybe she wouldn't be wandering now, a lost soul in the shadow of her former self.\n\nLise didn't have to lift a finger, and Carrie had already fallen, utterly broken and beyond redemption.\n\nChapter 5 A Gathering\nMeanwhile, in the Oasis Club, renowned as the priciest spot in Orkset, the air within the VIP room crackled with excitement. Under the spell of bright lights and thumping music, a diverse group of men and women lounged together, basking in the exclusivity of the setting.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, revealing Kristopher in the doorway.\n\nThe karaoke session halted abruptly as the crowd turned to greet him in unison, voices mingling. \"Kristopher...\"\n\nBefore they could utter another word, a woman cloaked from head to toe stepped out from behind him.\n\nLise, with a fluid motion, removed her mask and slid her arm through Kristopher's. She addressed the room with a poised charm. \"My assistant took a sudden leave, and I found myself without company. Not keen on spending the evening alone, I invited Kristopher to join me. I trust that's alright?\"\n\nLise's beauty was without question. Her face was a delicate composition of cherry lips and a sculpted nose, framed by eyes that shimmered with a vulnerable allure, commanding a protective fervor from those around her--her presence, ethereal.\n\nIn contrast, Carrie's features were more pronounced, her beauty vivid and striking. Lise, by comparison, carried a softer, more understated elegance.\n\nYet, as it often goes, matters of the heart followed no simple paths.\n\nWhile Kristopher and Carrie were married, it was in name only; Kristopher seemed detached and seldom included her in private social events.\n\nThe group didn't have much of a relationship with Carrie, leading them to feel no obligation to defend her.\n\nUpon hearing Lise's comment, a moment of discomfort rippled through the air. Nonetheless, they quickly recovered, offering a congenial smile as they said, \"We're all friends here; let's not bother with formalities.\"\n\nLise offered a subtle, knowing smile, as she gracefully accompanied Kristopher into the bustling room.\n\nThe event that evening had been meticulously planned to express appreciation for Kristopher's contributions.\n\nAs they stepped into the room, the crowd parted like the sea, making way for them to proceed to the seats of honor.\n\nThe group's leader handed Kristopher a glass of wine with a flourish, proclaiming with a broad grin, \"We truly owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Norris! Your exceptional talents are the talk of the town, and witnessing them firsthand today only confirms it. Without your expertise, securing this contract would have been a fantasy!\"\n\nTheir gathering marked the launch of a novel shopping platform, one that had been in negotiation with numerous local brands in Orkset. But the scenario changed dramatically when the tech giant JoyBuy dramatically entered the scene, stirring up the competitive landscape.\n\nCompeting with JoyBuy was akin to the classic David versus Goliath tale--hopelessly daunting. In a surge of desperation, they turned to Kristopher, reaching out through a network of connections for his renowned strategic prowess.\n\nWith his characteristic swiftness, Kristopher hatched an ingenious plan and swiftly secured the deal, snatching it from the clutches of JoyBuy right before the business association could ink their agreement--a masterful coup that reverberated success.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround only intensified the already deep respect everyone held for Kristopher.\n\nAlbin Murray, beaming with pride, couldn't help but boast, \"Ah, just look at the caliber of his friends! They thought they could steal deals right under our noses, obviously underestimating Kristopher's clout!\"\n\nAlbin, born into the wealthy Murray family, counted himself among Kristopher's closest friends. He was renowned for his sprawling social web--a network through which the desperate plea for help was channeled to Kristopher.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristopher himself, the focus of all their discussions, reclined nonchalantly on the couch, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe was well-versed in the art of receiving compliments; thus, his expression stayed calm and detached.\n\nThe ambient light sculpted his angular features, casting dramatic shadows that emphasized his high nose bridge and sharply cut jawline, as though he were a living masterpiece.\n\nHis natural grace and detachment eclipsed any terrestrial magnificence.\n\nFollowing a sequence of celebratory toasts, when it became apparent that Kristopher merely touched his glass without truly drinking, the rest of the company toned down their conversation, allowing him a moment of repose with his eyes gently shut.\n\nLise, slightly feverish, opted not to indulge in the spirits, choosing instead to sit in serene silence next to Kristopher, her eyes lingering on him with a look of deep, unmistakable adoration.\n\nAlbin, captivated by the seemingly perfect pair, pondered the whims of destiny. He discreetly captured their image with his smartphone and nonchalantly shared it across his social networks.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the liquor dwindled, the room's door swung open anew.\n\nKristopher's personal assistant, Oliver Brooks, made his entrance, acknowledging the gathering with a courteous nod that bordered on respect but avoided groveling, swiftly positioning himself in front of Kristopher.\n\nSilence hung in the air, yet Lise, unable to contain her curiosity, leaned in and whispered, \"What's going on?\"\n\nOliver, maintaining his focus on Kristopher, chose not to respond directly to her.\n\nA flush of embarrassment tinted Lise's cheeks as she turned towards Kristopher, hesitatingly inquiring, \"Should I leave?\"\n\nKristopher adjusted his posture, his voice low and calm as he instructed, \"Go ahead, speak.\"\n\nA shiver of apprehension coursed through Oliver as he tentatively began, \"Mr. Norris, Mrs. Norris has departed from Bayview Villa, and...\"\n\n&9&\n0:00 / 4:50",

        "primary_text": "\"He finally remembered the woman waiting for him at home, only to face her divorce papers. Confident she'd regret it, he signed. But post-divorce, she blossomed, turning heads everywhere. Defeated, he begged to win her back!\n=====\nIn the bustling, weathered heart of Orkset, flames erupted violently within an ancient apartment building. Propelled by gusts of wind, the fire devoured the structure, belching dense smoke and bright, searing tongues of flame.\n\n\"Saved! They've been saved.\" The words echoed amidst the chaos.\n\nFirefighters emerged from the smoldering inferno, carrying Carrie Campbell to safety at the roadside.\n\nHer features, usually refined and expressive, were now smeared with soot; her sparkling eyes dimmed to a vacant gaze, hollow and lost.\n\nAs reality seeped back into her consciousness, Carrie felt a rush of gratitude overpower her usual composure. Her voice, hoarse and weak, conveyed a profound \"thank you\" to her rescuers. Shaking, she fumbled for her phone, her fingertips quivering as they found the familiar number.\n\n\"Hello, the person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe automated message played after a few rings, leaving her with a lump in her throat, her unvoiced frustrations and sorrow welling up inside her.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a deafening roar, the explosion abruptly silenced the cold, mechanical voice echoing through the line. Carrie's head snapped upwards, shock painted on her face as she witnessed the apartment she had just exited erupt into flames.\n\nChunks of debris were hurled into the air by the force of the blast, scattering across the sky.\n\nPanic engulfed the crowd as survivors, freshly rescued, screamed in terror. They huddled together, seeking solace in each other's arms, their cries piercing the tumultuous scene. In stark contrast, Carrie lay alone on a stretcher, her isolation magnified amidst the chaos.\n\n\"Kristopher...\" Fighting the dread creeping up her spine, Carrie pressed her lips together tightly and dialed her husband's number again, her resolve unwavering.\n\nYet, the call disconnected after a few short rings, leaving her with a haunting silence.\n\nJust then, a Twitter notification flickered on her phone screen.\n\nThe gossip feed was alive with the latest gossip: #LiseNash #MysteriouBoyfriend.\n\nAccording to the tweet, a producer from a well-known variety show had invited the renowned star Lise Nash to a dinner, which had quickly soured when she declined to partake in a toast.\n\nThis act of defiance had sparked a confrontation, only to be interrupted by Lise's domineering boyfriend. He stormed into the private dining room, dismissing the producer with a dismissive wave and escorting Lise away.\n\nThe tweet described the scene vividly, painting a picture of a powerful man defending his beloved partner.\n\nYet, perhaps due to his prominence, only the back of the man was visible in the accompanying photos, preserving his anonymity. Meanwhile, Lise, donning an oversized suit jacket, beamed a smile, reaching out to clasp his hand as they departed together.\n\nCarrie's eyes were glued to the screen, her stare intense and unblinking as she absorbed the image before her.\n\nThere he was--Kristopher Norris!\n\nThe suit jacket draped carelessly over Lise was a dead giveaway.\n\nEvery piece of clothing Kristopher owned had been meticulously tailored by a master craftsman abroad, a detail Carrie knew all too well.\n\nHer grip on her phone tightened, her knuckles blanching to a stark white, as if her very soul were being squeezed by an invisible hand, the pain sharp and acid-like in its intensity.\n\nIn her most desperate moment, Kristopher had coldly disconnected their call, choosing instead to be at Lise's side.\n\nWhat was the worth of their two-year marriage?\n\nThe tears she had been holding back now overwhelmed her, streaming down her face.\n\nEven as she tilted her head back in a futile attempt to stem the flow, the tears continued to escape.\n\nLise had always been Kristopher's first love, a fact whispered and gossiped about among their circles. The Norris family had never approved of Lise, seeing her ordinary background as unfitting.\n\nForced apart by family pressures, it had been Lise who ended things, but the past, it seemed, was not easily left behind.\n\nKristopher had diligently pursued the leadership of the Norris family, harboring dreams of finally being with Lise.\n\nYet, when he reached his goal, he discovered that Lise had already chosen another.\n\nIn defiance of his family's expectations and perhaps out of bitterness, Kristopher turned to Carrie, a woman equally devoid of wealth or status, to become Mrs. Norris, thereby blocking any matchmaking attempts by his relatives.\n\nAt that time, Carrie faced immense pressure from her father, Tristan Campbell, who was pushing her towards a marriage with a playboy, the son of a business associate, to cover her grandmother's steep medical expenses.\n\nBoth Kristopher and Carrie, driven by their personal motives, consented to a marriage of convenience.\n\nOriginally set for just one year, their contractual marriage stretched beyond its term, sustained by a shared understanding between them.\n\nOver time, Carrie began to believe in the authenticity of their union, never suspecting that it was merely an extension of her hopes.\n\nJust moments ago, a fire had nearly claimed Carrie's life. In that critical moment, she reached out to Kristopher, only to be twice rebuffed as he spent his time with Lise.\n\nThis harsh reality shattered Carrie's illusions, revealing that her perceived transition from pretense to genuine relationship was nothing but a facade maintained by her own desires.\n\nCarrie wasn't even a temporary substitute in Kristopher's life but merely a pawn used to spite his family.\n\nAfter a poignant pause, tears welled up in Carrie's eyes, unstoppable and poignant.\n\nIt might be time for her to release herself from the shackles of her own hopeful delusions--to stop deceiving herself.\n\nChapter 2 Trending Topics\nThe overwhelming number of injuries from the fire was staggering, straining the already frantic doctors and nurses as they tried to provide aid.\n\nCarrie had been merely grazed by a splintered clothes rack, which left a deep, jagged wound on her calf. In comparison to the chaos around her, her wounds seemed almost negligible.\n\nShe managed to get basic care--a brisk cleaning and a quick wrap of bandages--at a local hospital before catching a cab back to her house.\n\nBayview Villa, a grand property under Kristopher's name, was technically their matrimonial residence.\n\nLiving alone had become the norm for Carrie, as Kristopher was hardly ever around. She had bid farewell to the housekeeper, discovering that her life could be quite adequately maintained with just takeout, deliveries, and the occasional visit from a part-time cleaner.\n\nNow, she found herself the sole occupant of the sprawling living room, sinking into the sofa, her gaze drifting across the empty space.\n\nThe stark, monochrome decor did nothing to imbue warmth into the atmosphere.\n\nA chilling realization crept up on her: this vast, elegant space felt more like a colossal tomb, a silent grave for her lost years of youth and a love that had quietly slipped away.\n\nIn this cold, echoing house, would anyone even notice if her breath ceased one day?\n\nCarrie exhaled a weary sigh, her frame heavy as she leaned against the cold wall for support, struggling up the stairs to her bedroom on the second floor.\n\nEach step was a battle, sending stabbing pains shooting through her from the surface of her skin down to her aching bones.\n\nThe house, stark and hollow, echoed even the smallest sounds, magnifying her sense of isolation.\n\nIt was today, amidst this profound silence, that Carrie truly grasped the all-encompassing nature of her loneliness--it was almost tangible, enveloping her senses with its texture and mournful whispers, tightening around her heart like a vice, producing a dull, relentless ache.\n\nUpon reaching the sanctuary of her bedroom, she collapsed onto the bed, the very embodiment of exhaustion, feeling it both physically and spiritually.\n\nJust as she surrendered to this weariness, the sharp ring of the phone pierced the silence.\n\n\"You reached out to me earlier. What do you need?\" Kristopher's voice cut through the line, cold and distant as ever.\n\nCarrie was caught off guard by his unexpected call. Words failed her as she parted her lips to respond, but before she could collect her thoughts, a soft, feminine voice floated through from the other end. \"Kristopher, will you join me to...\"\n\nA surge of emotions tightened Carrie's grip on the phone, her heart thumping louder with each second. Overwhelmed and unable to contain her rising panic, she demanded, \"Who's there with you?\"\n\nKristopher gave no answer, merely stating in a flat, disinterested voice, \"If there's something you need, let's catch up when I'm back. I have pressing engagements right now, so I must disconnect.\"\n\nHe promptly ended the call, cutting off any chance for Carrie to reply.\n\nAs the harsh beep of the disconnected line filled her ears, Carrie's lips twisted into a rueful grin. How utterly foolish she felt! Deep down, she knew his response all too well, yet she had clung to the hope of hearing his voice confirm it.\n\nWith a sense of self-inflicted irony, Carrie activated her tablet and scrolled through the day's hot topics.\n\nOne headline caught her eye: \"A female star shielded from harassment at a dinner by her formidable partner.\" A wry smile twisted her lips.\n\nCarrie knew all too well what it was like to face harassment at those kinds of dinners.\n\nShe vividly remembered her first major audition after her entering the showbiz; her agent had escorted her to a dinner with the influential director and producer of the drama series \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nAs a novice in the dizzying world of showbiz, Carrie had felt incredibly vulnerable, uncertain of how to navigate the murky waters of such gatherings.\n\nThe producer had eyed her shamelessly, sneering as he asked, \"Is this the new talent you're introducing? She appears presentable, but I'm curious to see how she fares with a drink. Here's the deal, if you can gulp down this bottle in one go, I'll secure you an audition for the lead role.\"\n\nCarrie was inclined to decline, but under the relentless pressure from her agent, she found herself compelled to consume the entire bottle.\n\nAs the evening wore on, she was hurriedly taken to the hospital suffering from a severe stomach ailment.\n\nHer agent, fretful about the prospect of the role slipping away to another, quickly settled the hospital charges and departed.\n\nAt that time, Carrie found herself isolated in a hospital bed for several long days.\n\nYet, even before Carrie could be released from the hospital, the media was abuzz with the announcement that Lise had secured the lead role in \"Serene Sighs.\"\n\nSubsequently, her agent rebuked Carrie for her lack of ambition, complaining, \"You are more appealing than Lise, so why can't you show more drive? She cozied up to Mr. Norris and hardly had to make an effort. She's surrounded by people eager to cater to her every need. I've heard that Mr. Norris personally orchestrated her landing the lead role in this production!\"\n\nWhen the show premiered, Lise was catapulted into stardom, swiftly ascending to the elite echelons of the acting world.\n\nFrom that moment forward, Carrie let her acting aspirations wane and chose instead to devote herself entirely to supporting her husband, Kristopher.\n\nAfter all, no matter her efforts, she could never get the same career opportunities that Lise seemed to receive effortlessly with Kristopher's offhand remarks.\n\nAt that time, Carrie had believed she was filling the role that was meant to be Lise's as Mrs. Norris, which meant she owed Lise.\n\nBy giving up the career opportunities to Lise, Carrie thought they would settle their unspoken debt.\n\nHowever, Carrie hadn't foreseen that Lise would claim both the coveted career and Kristopher's affections.\n\nAs Lise's professional and love life blossomed, Carrie came to the painful realization that she had been overly consumed with her romantic pursuits, at the expense of her career, and now, she found herself bereft of both love and professional fulfillment.\n\nWith tears streaming down her face, Carrie viewed her past two years as tragically misguided.\n\nGiven another opportunity, she resolved she wouldn't be so unguarded, letting her heart recklessly fall captive to Kristopher's charm.\n\n\"Ms. Spencer, the new copyright contract is prepared. Please review it for any discrepancies.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed with the alert, snapping Carrie out of her reverie. She gazed at the PDF file attached in the message, her mind briefly overwhelmed.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Katrina Spencer, Carrie had once made a name for herself as a budding screenwriter, selling numerous scripts in her early days.\n\nDuring her early career as Katrina, Carrie often sold her work for a pittance, compelled by her urgent need for immediate cash.\n\nOver the years, these scripts transformed into blockbuster films and hit series, catapulting Katrina's reputation to new heights.\n\nBy this time, Carrie had married Kristopher and was no longer plagued by the financial woes that had once driven her to desperation--her grandmother's hefty medical bills were a thing of the past. With her financial crises resolved, Carrie's life had pivoted to domestic responsibilities, striving to be an exemplary wife to Kristopher. Amidst these changes, her pseudonym, Katrina Spencer, gradually receded into the background.\n\nHowever, her past as Katrina wasn't ready to be shelved just yet. Recently, an interested buyer had come forward, ready to pay a handsome sum for one of her old scripts.\n\nCarrie, however, was hesitant to sell. She raised several concerns about the contract presented to her, and to her astonishment, the buyer was genuine enough to revise it accordingly.\n\nHolding the revised contract in her hands, Carrie inhaled deeply, her resolve hardening. She seemed to have reached a crucial decision.\n\nHer fingers danced over her phone's keyboard with swift precision, typing out a firm command. \"Create a divorce agreement following my terms and ensure it reaches Kristopher Norris at the Norris Group.\"\n\nWithout pausing for a response, she placed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step echoing a blend of determination and newfound independence.\n\nChapter 3 Exchange Of Conveniences\nThirty minutes had passed, Carrie finally heaved herself up from the bathtub, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. As she lifted her gaze, her own image in the mirror halted her movements--her skin appeared as smooth and impeccable as fine porcelain, glowing with an unblemished radiance.\n\nHer eyes, deep pools of allure, sparkled with an enchanting, soft warmth, inviting anyone who dared meet her gaze.\n\nDespite edging into her late twenties at twenty-five, she reveled in the fact that time had yet to etch its marks upon her flawless complexion.\n\nSurely, a woman with such a visage had no place for self-pity.\n\nAbsorbed in her contemplation, Carrie carelessly extended her right leg onto the cold floor, forgetting it was the very limb she had injured. Wrapped excessively in cling film to shield it from moisture, the tight encasement had stifled her circulation, rendering her leg eerily numb. As her foot touched down, it betrayed her, slipping forward unexpectedly.\n\n\"Ah!\" Carrie gasped, her arms flailing in a frantic ballet, searching for a lifeline in the void.\n\nJust as she teetered on the brink of a painful rendezvous with the floor, the bathroom door burst open.\n\nKristopher stood at the entrance, his suit immaculately tailored, creating a striking figure. As their eyes locked, he paused, visibly taken aback, then quickly closed the distance with brisk strides.\n\nCarrie's breath caught as Kristopher swept her up in a graceful bridal style, an unexpected tightness wrapping around her waist. Caught off guard by his sudden appearance, Carrie realized with a jolt that she was completely bare. A flush of embarrassment washed over her as she instinctively clutched her hands over her chest.\n\nThis was their first moment of such intimacy since their wedding, and the discomfort made her toes curl inward, her skin blushing a delicate shade of pink.\n\nKristopher looked down at her with a mischievous grin. \"Let's be honest, there's not much to see,\" he teased gently.\n\nFeeling both mortified and slightly irritated, Carrie snapped back, \"Oh, Mr. Norris, after all you've seen, I suppose nothing can impress you anymore.\"\n\nShe carried her C-cup curves with understated charm, a touch of sensuality that outshone Lise's painfully flat, almost awkwardly rigid build.\n\nYet Carrie knew well that without love, even the most perfect physique paled in comparison to the charm of one dearly cherished.\n\nNonchalantly, Kristopher reached for a bathrobe hanging behind the door and draped it over her. His frown deepened at her comment. \"What are you talking about, Carrie?\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike him, and his expression grew even more impatient. \"Tell me, did you send those divorce papers in the dead of night just to lure me back here--to catch you completely bare?\" His tone was a mix of disbelief and annoyance. \"I told you I was swamped with work. Was this dramatic display really necessary?\"\n\nCarrie's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the tension between them. He was always so quick to lose patience with her.\n\nShe wasn't the type to throw around words like divorce or breakups lightly. In fact, this was the first time she'd ever mentioned divorce in their two-year marriage, yet he seemed indifferent to her turmoil. He simply dismissed her concerns as if she were overreacting about trivial matters.\n\nDespite the throbbing pain in her leg, Carrie mustered her strength and said, \"Put me down.\"\n\nKristopher, however, paid no heed, his eyes scanning her leg swathed in bandages. His brow furrowed slightly. \"What happened to your leg? Is this some elaborate ploy to lure me back?\"\n\nAt his words, a bitter laugh escaped Carrie.\n\nIt seemed he viewed her as merely seeking attention, and in failing to capture it, she had likely concocted a story to draw him back, allowing her to dramatize her plight in his presence.\n\nWith a blank face, she replied untruthfully, \"It's a beauty treatment that shouldn't get wet.\"\n\n\"Why did you suddenly decide to undergo such a treatment?\" Kristopher inquired, his tone casual as he carried her outside, not pressing the issue further.\n\nHis frame was large, and through his thin shirt, she could distinctly feel the warmth of his body and the defined shape of his chest muscles.\n\nThe closeness created an uncomfortable tension for Carrie, who had resolved to end things once and for all.\n\nHer voice climbed involuntarily, sharper this time. \"Oh, since when have you been concerned with such minor things, Mr. Norris?\"\n\nFor the first time, Kristopher witnessed her using biting sarcasm; it struck him as peculiarly amusing. With a calm demeanor, he responded, \"You're my wife, it's only natural I'd be concerned about your well-being.\"\n\n\"Really?\" There was a somber note in Carrie's voice now. \"It seems like you've never really regarded me as your wife. I'm scared that if I were to die, you wouldn't even know until much later.\"\n\nAfter all, at that very moment, Kristopher had been distracted, lost in moments with his first love, too consumed to lend an ear to her desperate pleas.\n\nCaught off guard by her accusation, Kristopher's eyes widened with surprise before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. \"Carrie, what's brought on this sudden outburst of anger? Just because I was tied up this afternoon and missed your call? Perhaps I've been too indulgent with you lately, and it's made you a bit too presumptuous?\"\n\nCarrie froze, startled. Was he accusing her of being too presumptuous?\n\nShe realized their marriage had always been lopsided. In his eyes, she was nothing more than a transactional partner, a woman who had bartered her freedom for financial security.\n\nTheir union was meant to be a mere exchange of conveniences, yet she had, quite foolishly, fallen deeply in love with him.\n\nIn the tricky terrain of romance, the one who fell first invariably found themselves at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nKristopher's dismissive reaction left Carrie reeling, her emotions dismissed as trifles, a tight knot of suffocation rising in her chest.\n\n\"I said to put me down this instant!\" Carrie exclaimed, jerking her head to the side, her voice laced with a sharp edge of impatience.\n\nKristopher remained mute, effortlessly carrying her towards the bed before suddenly releasing his hold.\n\nCarrie felt a jolt as the support vanished, her heart skipping a beat as she instinctively grasped for him.\n\nTheir bodies collided on the bed, her bathrobe teetering on the brink of decency, threatening to unravel with any minor shift.\n\nPropped on one elbow, Kristopher gazed down at her, his lips curled into a sly, teasing grin. \"You wanted to be let go, didn't you? So why cling to me now?\"\n\nHis eyes, deep and sparkling like a midnight lake speckled with stars, captivated her.\n\nIn those celestial depths, Carrie caught a glimpse of her own reflection.\n\nAt times like this, she was misled into believing he harbored a deep affection.\n\nSadly, his heart was a fortress reserved for Lise, and all Carrie had left were empty fantasies.\n\n\"Boring!\" she exclaimed, her voice devoid of any enthusiasm as she attempted to rise, her hand inadvertently brushing against something unexpected.\n\nThe following moment brought a noticeable shift in his cock pressing against her stomach.\n\n\"Don't move, or I can't promise what might happen next,\" he warned in a deep, gravelly voice.\n\nWith a frown, Carrie internally cursed upon hearing the statement.\n\nIt was an undeniable fact. Primal instincts steered the actions of men. Absence of affection didn't quell their basic desires.\n\nYet, she dared not agitate Kristopher. Angling her face away, her body remained rigid, frozen in place.\n\nCarrie, feeling irked, shot back. \"Didn't you say there's nothing here to see? What's with the reaction now, Mr. Norris? Are you really that easy to impress?\"\n\nNo sooner had her words flown than she grasped the potential repercussions of her sharp tongue.\n\nA wave of regret surged through Carrie, but instead of anger, Kristopher responded with a chuckle, \"You are my wife, after all. Since that's something I can't alter, I might as well embrace it. Besides, it's been years since we became husband and wife--it would be a shame to neglect you completely.\"\n\nChapter 4 Are You Out Of Your Mind?\nKristopher slipped his hand beneath the folds of her bathrobe, his touch tracing the curve of Carrie's skin, as smooth and delicate as silk. He encircled her slender waist, drawing her closer with a gentle yet firm grip.\n\nHer face, a captivating canvas of defiance and visible irritation, ignited in him an uncontrollable urge to claim victory over her resistance.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy, yet he remained composed, slowly removing his tailored suit.\n\nThe fabric of his suit brushed lightly against Carrie's cheek, releasing a mix of scents: a familiar woody aroma intertwined with an unexpected zesty twist of lemon. It was unmistakably Jo Malone's Blue Agava and Cacao--Lise's signature scent.\n\nA surge of nausea overwhelmed Carrie at the realization.\n\nAs Kristopher's eyes, now shaded with a stormy intensity, drew nearer to hers, the proximity conjured unwelcome visions of him with Lise. Her stomach churned violently, and with a sudden movement, she pushed him away, propping herself up with a jolt and a dry retch.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer stomach had been empty all day, leaving her with nothing to bring up.\n\nThe desire in Kristopher's gaze flickered out, replaced by a cold, detached expression as he withdrew slightly.\n\nObserving the genuine distress and the reddening of Carrie's eyes, Kristopher perceived her reaction for outright disgust at their closeness.\n\nHe paused, fingers adjusting his shirt cuffs, his voice cold as he confronted her. \"Carrie, is this reaction reserved only for me, or is it how you respond to all men?\"\n\nThe air in the room turned frosty, thick with tension.\n\nCarrie swallowed the sharp sting in her throat, her eyes widening in shock as she stared up at him.\n\nEver since their marriage, she had cut ties with nearly all her male friends, yet here was Kristopher, casually tossing out comments sharp enough to cut glass.\n\nThe years of love she had poured into their relationship now seemed utterly futile.\n\nHeat crept up her neck, coloring her cheeks a bright scarlet as indignation took hold. Without thinking, her hand flew up and delivered a stinging slap across Kristopher's face.\n\nAll her suppressed grievances from the day ignited in that swift motion.\n\nHer bathrobe, loosened in the heat of the moment, slipped from her shoulders. Ignoring the flush of exposure, she swiftly gathered the fabric and draped it around herself, her movements quick and firm.\n\nThe impact of her slap had left a light, crimson mark on Kristopher's cheek, marking him with her outrage.\n\nHis eyes, wide with disbelief, met hers. \"Carrie, are you out of your mind?\"\n\nOut of her mind? Yes, she was clearly insane to ever fall for him in the first place.\n\nCarrie fumed silently, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nSuddenly, the sharp buzz of the phone on the table cut through the mounting tension, its vibration bringing a brief respite from their standoff.\n\nKristopher cast a fleeting glance at the message, shut off the phone with a snap, and strode towards the door, his back rigid with tension.\n\nHer voice, firm and unwavering, chased after him. \"We're getting a divorce! Make sure you sign those papers before you walk out that door!\"\n\nKristopher paused briefly and said sharply, \"I have something to do now. When I return, do whatever pleases you.\" With that, he forcefully shut the door.\n\nCarrie's eyes followed his unwavering exit, feeling an oppressive weight compressing her chest once again.\n\nShe disregarded the sharp sting in her leg and hobbled determinedly toward her tablet. Fingers trembling, she hastily navigated to Lise's Twitter page.\n\nLise had just uploaded a new tweet.\n\nThe photo showed her lying down with a fever patch adhered to her forehead, still enveloped in Kristopher's familiar jacket.\n\nThe caption read, \"Being sick makes me extra clingy. Wishing I had someone here. Stay cozy and take care, everyone!\"\n\nThe simultaneous timing of these two events made it almost impossible for Carrie not to suspect that Kristopher had dashed off to tend to Lise.\n\nCarrie's instincts loudly proclaimed that this was no accident; Lise had deliberately sought to tug at Kristopher's heartstrings. It appeared her tactics were effective.\n\nNot even Carrie's stark threat of divorce could overshadow Lise's theatrical display of vulnerability.\n\nSeething with fury, Carrie quaked like a leaf swept into a storm.\n\nShe steeled herself against the heartache, forcefully ripping the plastic wrap from her aching leg.\n\nAfter her lengthy soak, the bath's lingering moisture had infiltrated her skin, inflaming the wound until it was a vivid, angry red and painfully swollen.\n\nShe, too, could be clingy. Even in the harshest times back in the county, she had shown vulnerability, breaking down into soft sobs within the comforting arms of her grandmother, especially that one time she got burned by the scalding kettle.\n\nBut such vulnerability had its time and place, and it wasn't now.\n\nThe stark reality of Kristopher's exit forced Carrie to confront her need for self-reliance.\n\nBiting down hard on her lip, Carrie cleaned the throbbing wound with a practiced hand before securely wrapping it anew.\n\nShe rose with a newfound resolve and yanked a black suitcase from the far end of her expansive walk-in closet--it held all the belongings she'd brought into this house as a hopeful bride.\n\nShe grabbed a fresh set of clothes to slip into and left a bank card neatly on the bedside table.\n\nShe had transferred every penny she'd earned over the past year onto that card, effectively settling her financial entanglements with Kristopher over the last two years and cutting him out of her life for good.\n\nDragging the heavy suitcase behind her, she limped painfully out of the opulent villa.\n\nAs she passed through the gate, she wrapped her baseball jacket more tightly around her slight figure, her silhouette hauntingly solitary in the enveloping darkness.\n\nThe night air of early spring was bitingly cold, devoid of any trace of warmth, a chill that seemed almost faint compared to the ice forming in Carrie's shattered heart.\n\nShe had arrived here with nothing but a suitcase and a heart full of dreams, and now she was leaving, dreams crumbled, utterly alone.\n\nA bitter laugh slipped through her lips. If only she hadn't fallen so hard for him, if only she'd proposed an amicable separation at the end of their agreed year, maybe she wouldn't be wandering now, a lost soul in the shadow of her former self.\n\nLise didn't have to lift a finger, and Carrie had already fallen, utterly broken and beyond redemption.\n\nChapter 5 A Gathering\nMeanwhile, in the Oasis Club, renowned as the priciest spot in Orkset, the air within the VIP room crackled with excitement. Under the spell of bright lights and thumping music, a diverse group of men and women lounged together, basking in the exclusivity of the setting.\n\nSuddenly, the door burst open, revealing Kristopher in the doorway.\n\nThe karaoke session halted abruptly as the crowd turned to greet him in unison, voices mingling. \"Kristopher...\"\n\nBefore they could utter another word, a woman cloaked from head to toe stepped out from behind him.\n\nLise, with a fluid motion, removed her mask and slid her arm through Kristopher's. She addressed the room with a poised charm. \"My assistant took a sudden leave, and I found myself without company. Not keen on spending the evening alone, I invited Kristopher to join me. I trust that's alright?\"\n\nLise's beauty was without question. Her face was a delicate composition of cherry lips and a sculpted nose, framed by eyes that shimmered with a vulnerable allure, commanding a protective fervor from those around her--her presence, ethereal.\n\nIn contrast, Carrie's features were more pronounced, her beauty vivid and striking. Lise, by comparison, carried a softer, more understated elegance.\n\nYet, as it often goes, matters of the heart followed no simple paths.\n\nWhile Kristopher and Carrie were married, it was in name only; Kristopher seemed detached and seldom included her in private social events.\n\nThe group didn't have much of a relationship with Carrie, leading them to feel no obligation to defend her.\n\nUpon hearing Lise's comment, a moment of discomfort rippled through the air. Nonetheless, they quickly recovered, offering a congenial smile as they said, \"We're all friends here; let's not bother with formalities.\"\n\nLise offered a subtle, knowing smile, as she gracefully accompanied Kristopher into the bustling room.\n\nThe event that evening had been meticulously planned to express appreciation for Kristopher's contributions.\n\nAs they stepped into the room, the crowd parted like the sea, making way for them to proceed to the seats of honor.\n\nThe group's leader handed Kristopher a glass of wine with a flourish, proclaiming with a broad grin, \"We truly owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Norris! Your exceptional talents are the talk of the town, and witnessing them firsthand today only confirms it. Without your expertise, securing this contract would have been a fantasy!\"\n\nTheir gathering marked the launch of a novel shopping platform, one that had been in negotiation with numerous local brands in Orkset. But the scenario changed dramatically when the tech giant JoyBuy dramatically entered the scene, stirring up the competitive landscape.\n\nCompeting with JoyBuy was akin to the classic David versus Goliath tale--hopelessly daunting. In a surge of desperation, they turned to Kristopher, reaching out through a network of connections for his renowned strategic prowess.\n\nWith his characteristic swiftness, Kristopher hatched an ingenious plan and swiftly secured the deal, snatching it from the clutches of JoyBuy right before the business association could ink their agreement--a masterful coup that reverberated success.\n\nThis remarkable turnaround only intensified the already deep respect everyone held for Kristopher.\n\nAlbin Murray, beaming with pride, couldn't help but boast, \"Ah, just look at the caliber of his friends! They thought they could steal deals right under our noses, obviously underestimating Kristopher's clout!\"\n\nAlbin, born into the wealthy Murray family, counted himself among Kristopher's closest friends. He was renowned for his sprawling social web--a network through which the desperate plea for help was channeled to Kristopher.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristopher himself, the focus of all their discussions, reclined nonchalantly on the couch, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights.\n\nHe was well-versed in the art of receiving compliments; thus, his expression stayed calm and detached.\n\nThe ambient light sculpted his angular features, casting dramatic shadows that emphasized his high nose bridge and sharply cut jawline, as though he were a living masterpiece.\n\nHis natural grace and detachment eclipsed any terrestrial magnificence.\n\nFollowing a sequence of celebratory toasts, when it became apparent that Kristopher merely touched his glass without truly drinking, the rest of the company toned down their conversation, allowing him a moment of repose with his eyes gently shut.\n\nLise, slightly feverish, opted not to indulge in the spirits, choosing instead to sit in serene silence next to Kristopher, her eyes lingering on him with a look of deep, unmistakable adoration.\n\nAlbin, captivated by the seemingly perfect pair, pondered the whims of destiny. He discreetly captured their image with his smartphone and nonchalantly shared it across his social networks.\n\nAs the evening progressed and the liquor dwindled, the room's door swung open anew.\n\nKristopher's personal assistant, Oliver Brooks, made his entrance, acknowledging the gathering with a courteous nod that bordered on respect but avoided groveling, swiftly positioning himself in front of Kristopher.\n\nSilence hung in the air, yet Lise, unable to contain her curiosity, leaned in and whispered, \"What's going on?\"\n\nOliver, maintaining his focus on Kristopher, chose not to respond directly to her.\n\nA flush of embarrassment tinted Lise's cheeks as she turned towards Kristopher, hesitatingly inquiring, \"Should I leave?\"\n\nKristopher adjusted his posture, his voice low and calm as he instructed, \"Go ahead, speak.\"\n\nA shiver of apprehension coursed through Oliver as he tentatively began, \"Mr. Norris, Mrs. Norris has departed from Bayview Villa, and...\"\n\n&9&\n0:00 / 4:50",

        "primary_text": "For three long years, Lin Shu had yearned day and night to return home and reunite with Fu Mingcheng. Yet she never imagined that on her very first day back, she would be greeted with divorce papers.\n\n        \"Divorce? This joke isn‚Äôt funny at all.\"\n\n        Lin Shu looked at the man sitting across from her. Dressed in a tailored black suit, he was as aloof and dignified as ever. It was the same face she had dreamed of for years, yet now it felt utterly unfamiliar.\n\n        \"I‚Äôm busy and don‚Äôt have time for jokes. Read the divorce agreement. If there are no issues, sign it,\" Fu Mingcheng replied coldly.\n\n        \"Can I at least know why?\" Lin Shu‚Äôs voice trembled.\n\n        \"Lin Shu, you left for three years. During that time, it was Zhiyi who stood by my side. We supported each other, and that‚Äôs how Fu Media reached where it is today. I don‚Äôt want to let her down.\"\n\n        \"So you‚Äôd rather let *me* down? Fu Mingcheng, did I *choose* to leave you for three years? I was taking care of your mother!\"\n\n        Three years ago, just after they had registered their marriage but before their wedding, Fu‚Äôs mother was diagnosed with kidney failure. With no suitable donor available domestically, the only option was treatment abroad. Lin Shu had spent those three years nursing her mother-in-law back to health, only to return and face Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs betrayal.\n\n        \"Mingcheng, do you remember what you said when you proposed to me?\"\n\n        Three years ago, Fu Mingcheng had knelt before her with a diamond ring, gazing into her eyes with sincerity. He had said, *\"Xiao Shu, give me the chance to be your partner and family. I‚Äôll stay by your side forever, cherish you, and love you‚Äîeven if the seas run dry and the rocks crumble to dust.\"*\n\n        Moved by his words, Lin Shu had willingly given up her flourishing career to care for his mother abroad. But now, though his vows still echoed in her ears, the man who had made them had given his heart to someone else.\n\n        \"I truly cared for you back then. But affection isn‚Äôt the same as love.\" A flicker of guilt finally surfaced in Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs cold eyes.\n\n        \"It wasn‚Äôt until I met Zhiyi that I understood what real love is. She‚Äôs nothing like you‚Äîshe isn‚Äôt some fragile vine that clings to a man for support. She‚Äôs a kapok tree, standing tall through storms. Despite her humble background, she‚Äôs resilient and hardworking. Under the spotlight, she shines so brilliantly‚Äîhow could I not be drawn to her...?\"\n\n        Lin Shu had no interest in hearing about his affair. She cut him off with a bitter laugh.\n\n        \"She *shines*? She *drew you in*? Fu Mingcheng, have you forgotten? Before I married you, I was already the Golden Elephant Award‚Äôs Best Actress. I gave up my career *for you*.\"\n\n        \"I never forced you. That was your choice.\"\n\n        His words left her stunned.\n\n        \"Have you even discussed this divorce with your mother? She‚Äôd never agree to it.\" Lin Shu clenched her fists, forcing back tears.\n\n        \"Mom has already met Zhiyi. She‚Äôs gentle and clever‚ÄîMom adores her. Besides, Zhiyi is pregnant with my child. Mom is about to have a grandchild. Why would she object?\"\n\n        So, his entire family was content‚Äîonly she remained as the inconvenient obstacle.\n\n        Lin Shu felt as if something had pierced her heart, the pain stealing her breath.\n\n        For three years, she had cared for Fu‚Äôs mother single-handedly, feeding her, tending to her needs day and night‚Äîall because Fu‚Äôs mother disliked the impersonal touch of hired nurses.\n\n        Now that the old woman had recovered, it was time to discard the tool that had served its purpose.\n\n        Silence stretched between them.\n\n        Then, Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs phone buzzed on the table. Lin Shu caught the caller ID: *Zhiyi, my love*.\n\n        He picked up and stepped onto the balcony. Though she couldn‚Äôt hear his words, the tenderness on his face was one she hadn‚Äôt seen in years.\n\n        When he returned, his impatience was palpable. \"Lin Shu, I‚Äôve wronged you, and I‚Äôve made compensations in the divorce agreement. Let‚Äôs part amicably. Dragging this out will only humiliate you further.\"\n\n        With that, he stood and left.\n\n        The slam of the door reverberated through her chest, a dull, suffocating ache.\n\n        Lin Shu stared blankly at the divorce papers, her mind numb‚Äîuntil Wu Ma, her childhood nanny and the only person left who truly cared for her, entered the room.\n\n        \"Xiao Shu, are you alright?\" Wu Ma asked, her eyes full of worry.\n\n        \"Wu Ma...\" Lin Shu buried her face in the older woman‚Äôs embrace, tears finally spilling over. \"Wu Ma, am I a fool?\"\n\n        \"You silly child. I warned you long ago that these charity marriages come with risks. If the man has a conscience, you‚Äôre lucky. If not, you‚Äôre left swallowing blood with your broken teeth,\" Wu Ma sighed.\n\n        Three years ago, after Fu‚Äôs father died unexpectedly, the family‚Äôs financial chain collapsed, pushing them to the brink of bankruptcy. Lin Shu had used her late mother‚Äôs savings to bail them out. She then devoted three years abroad to caring for Fu‚Äôs mother so Fu Mingcheng could focus on rebuilding his career without distractions.\n\n        She had believed that as his wife, it was her duty to support his ambitions and tend to his family‚Äîso they could walk through life together.\n\n        Yet in the end, all her sacrifices had been nothing but her own delusion.\n\n        After crying, Lin Shu quickly wiped her tears and steeled herself.\n\n        She picked up her phone and dialed Jiang Nansheng, her best friend and former agent.\n\n        \"Nansheng, investigate all of Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs assets, as well as his relationship with Song Zhiyi over the past three years. Also, find me a reliable lawyer. I want a divorce.\"\n\n        There was a pause before Jiang Nansheng asked, \"Are you sure?\"\n\n        \"Yes.\"\n\n        \"Alright. Wait for my update.\"\n\n        After hanging up, Lin Shu noticed Wu Ma‚Äôs troubled expression.\n\n        \"Wu Ma, don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs just a divorce‚Äînot the end of the world.\"\n\n        \"Miss, marriage isn‚Äôt a game. Are you certain about this?\"\n\n        \"Yes,\" Lin Shu answered without hesitation. \"I slaved away overseas for his mother while he fooled around here, even knocking someone up. A man that filthy isn‚Äôt worth keeping.\"\n\n        \"But‚Äî\" Before Wu Ma could protest further, the door swung open. Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs younger sister, Fu Xiaoran, barged in unannounced.\n\n        \"Mom wants to see you,\" she announced haughtily.\n\n        \"Madam Fu must want to stop the divorce. Miss, she‚Äôs always favored you‚Äîyou must talk to her properly. If she persuades Mingcheng, he‚Äôll listen. He‚Äôs always been filial,\" Wu Ma urged, gripping Lin Shu‚Äôs hand. As someone of the older generation, she saw divorce as an earth-shattering matter.\n\n        Lin Shu pressed her lips together, her gaze dark and unreadable.\n\n        Fu Xiaoran scoffed. \"Figures you‚Äôd cling shamelessly to stay.\"\n\n        Ignoring the jab, Lin Shu followed her to Fu‚Äôs mother‚Äôs room.\n\n        The older woman sat on the bed, eyes red as if she‚Äôd been crying.\n\n        \"Xiao Shu...\" Fu‚Äôs mother choked out, grasping Lin Shu‚Äôs hands. \"That wretched son of mine hid this from me‚Äîit‚Äôs my fault for failing to raise him right. Our Fu family has wronged you. But Song Zhiyi is already pregnant... Mingcheng has no choice but to marry her.\"        Madame Fu held Lin Shu in her arms, coddling her like precious treasure. \"Xiao Shu, Mom knows you love Mingcheng and can't bear to be without him. Honestly, a marriage certificate is just a piece of paper‚Äîit doesn't really matter. Even if you and Mingcheng go through with the divorce, you can still stay in the Fu family. I only recognize you as my daughter-in-law.\"\n\n        Lin Shu had clung to a sliver of hope until now. After all, these past three years abroad, she and Madame Fu had relied on each other for survival. She had devoted herself to caring for the older woman, and Madame Fu had treated her with affection and concern‚Äîjust like a real mother and daughter.\n\n        Yet at this moment, the last remnants of her attachment to the Fu family evaporated.\n\n        \"So what you're saying is, you want me to become Fu Mingcheng's mistress after the divorce?\"\n\n        \"Xiao Shu, listen to Mom‚Äîdon't place so much importance on that piece of paper,\" Madame Fu said earnestly.\n\n        \"If a marriage certificate is so insignificant, why does Fu Mingcheng insist on divorcing me? Why can't Song Zhiyi just be his little mistress then?\"\n\n        \"Zhiyi-jie is a rising star‚Äîthe top actress at Fu Media. How could she ever be some secret mistress?\" Fu Xiaoran cut in impatiently.\n\n        Having studied domestically all this time, she was quite close with Song Zhiyi and had little affection for her actual sister-in-law, Lin Shu.\n\n        \"Song Zhiyi knew full well Fu Mingcheng was a married man, yet she still fooled around with him. She was a shameless mistress from the very beginning,\" Lin Shu retorted disdainfully.\n\n        \"You‚Äî!\" Fu Xiaoran's eyes flashed with anger, but before she could speak, Madame Fu interrupted.\n\n        \"Enough, don't make things worse,\" Madame Fu scolded her daughter half-heartedly before turning back to Lin Shu with a sigh. \"Xiao Shu, you know how it is‚ÄîZhiyi is currently the top star at Fu Media. The entire company relies on her. She refuses to stay in the shadows, so Mingcheng has no choice but to divorce you.\"\n\n        Finally, Lin Shu understood. Song Zhiyi was now a popular actress‚ÄîFu Media's top star who could bring the Fu family greater benefits. Meanwhile, she, the neglected wife, had long outlived her usefulness.\n\n        \"How is there no choice? Back when Fu Mingcheng didn't want me to go abroad with you, you cried, made a scene, and even threatened to kill yourself until he finally gave in. Why can't you do the same now?\"\n\n        Back then, she and Fu Mingcheng had just gotten married‚Äîstill in the honeymoon phase. Naturally, he hadn't wanted to be separated from her. But Madame Fu, unwilling to go abroad alone, had cried, made scenes, and even refused treatment, threatening suicide until Fu Mingcheng had no choice but to agree.\n\n        \"Lin Shu, who do you think you are, making Mom pressure my brother like this?\" Fu Xiaoran lashed out, hands on her hips.\n\n        Right‚Äîwhen it came to their own interests, they would stop at nothing. But for others? Not worth the effort. Lin Shu could only blame herself for being blind. She had actually believed the Fu family was kind and virtuous‚Äîgood people.\n\n        \"You two keep switching between good cop and bad cop‚Äîall just to kick me out. Fine. I agree to the divorce,\" she said wearily.\n\n        \"Hmph, at least you know what's good for you,\" Fu Xiaoran sneered, tilting her chin up. \"Then hurry up and move out. I'll give you one day‚Äîdon't even think about lingering.\"\n\n        \"Xiao Shu, Mom really doesn't want to let you go. I just... have no choice.\" Madame Fu clutched Lin Shu's hand while pressing the other to her chest, looking utterly heartbroken.\n\n        \"Madame Fu, this mother-daughter act of ours has run its course. Overdoing it just makes it tiresome,\" Lin Shu said coldly, shaking off her hand. She looked between the two women. \"I'll give you one day to move out. From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.\"\n\n        \"Lin Shu, have you lost your mind? This was my father's house‚ÄîFu family property! How dare you tell us to leave?\"\n\n        \"This villa was indeed purchased by your father before his death. But after he passed, the Fu family went bankrupt, and this house was auctioned off. If I hadn't bought it, you would've been homeless long ago. Now, get out of my villa‚Äîor I'll call the police for trespassing.\"\n\n        Lin Shu had no patience left for the Fu women. After delivering her ultimatum, she turned and left.\n\n        \"Mom, did you see how arrogant she was?\" Fu Xiaoran fumed, jabbing a finger toward the door.\n\n        \"Enough‚Äîwhy bother with her? Your brother already wrote in the divorce agreement that he'd give her a property as compensation. If she wants this villa so badly, let her have it. Mingcheng owns plenty of estates‚Äîmany better than this. It's not like we'll have nowhere to stay.\"\n\n        No sooner had Madame Fu finished speaking than a knock came at the door. A maid entered and said, \"Madame, the young mistress just left with her suitcase.\"\n\n        \"Left?\" Madame Fu was taken aback.\n\n        \"Thought she was so tough, but in the end, she still slunk away with her tail between her legs,\" Fu Xiaoran scoffed.\n\n        \"Lin Shu must've regretted speaking so harshly to us and left on her own. She's utterly devoted to your brother‚Äîotherwise, she wouldn't have waited on me so diligently these past three years. Once she comes to her senses in a few days and returns, be a little kinder to her. She's quite good at taking care of people. With her looking after me, you and your brother can focus on your careers without worries.\"\n\n        \"Fine. If she knows her place, I'll be nicer,\" Fu Xiaoran muttered reluctantly.\n\n        \"Where's your brother?\" Madame Fu asked.\n\n        \"He went out. Tonight, he's proposing to Zhiyi-jie‚Äîhe booked out an entire riverside hotel and arranged fireworks over the river.\"\n\n        \"Such a waste of money for all that show. When he proposed to Lin Shu, a simple ceremony was just fine.\" Madame Fu clearly disapproved, but remembering her new daughter-in-law's status as a top actress, she didn't press further.\n\n        ‚Ä¶\n\n        Lin Shu packed some essentials and, after leaving the Fu residence, went straight to Jiang Nansheng's apartment.\n\n        \"You're here so late‚Äîdid something happen?\" Jiang Nansheng opened the door to find Lin Shu perched on her suitcase outside. Her hair was tied in a ponytail, and she wore a simple T-shirt and jeans. Her large, moist eyes were slightly red at the corners, making her look like an abandoned little rabbit‚Äîpitiful and lost.\n\n        \"The Fu household was too depressing, so I'm staying with you for a couple of days,\" Lin Shu said with a shrug, dragging her suitcase inside.\n\n        Jiang Nansheng hastily tidied up the guest room. Seeing Lin Shu's pallor, she urged her to rest first.\n\n        Having just returned to the country, Lin Shu was still jet-lagged. She slept fitfully through the night and only learned the next morning that Fu Mingcheng had set off fireworks along the riverbank all night for Song Zhiyi‚Äîa spectacle that rocketed to the top of trending searches.\n\n        The love story between the domineering CEO and the popular star force-fed the public with sweetness. Soon after, Song Zhiyi's official account posted a prenatal exam slip, confirming they already had a \"love child\" on the way.\n\n        Since Lin Shu and Fu Mingcheng had only registered their marriage without holding a ceremony, only close friends and family knew of their relationship. To the public, Fu Mingcheng remained the golden bachelor‚Äîhis pairing with Song Zhiyi a match made in heaven.\n\n        \"That bastard Fu Mingcheng! When he proposed to you, he was so stingy‚Äîjust flowers and a ring, reeking of poverty. And you, the hopeless romantic, were moved to tears. Now he's splurging for another woman.\"\n\n        Jiang Nansheng was so furious after seeing the news that she skipped breakfast.\n\n        Lin Shu, however, never neglected her stomach. She sipped slowly from her bowl of congee. Yet despite the seafood congee's usual savory richness, it tasted strangely bitter now.\n\n        Back when she and Fu Mingcheng were together, the Fu family was on the brink of bankruptcy. All he had to offer was his sincerity‚Äîand Lin Shu had accepted it.\n\n        Now, with Fu Media thriving, spending millions in a single night to win a beauty's smile was simply the extravagance befitting President Fu.\n\n        \"Eating? How can you still eat? Aren't you angry at all?\" Jiang Nansheng glared at Lin Shu's unhurried motions, her temper flaring again.\n\n        \"Why should I be? Every cent he's burning now is from our shared marital assets. I'll make sure he returns every last penny.\"        Lin Shu set down her spoon, dabbed the corners of her lips with a soft tissue, and asked, \"Have you found everything I wanted?\"\n\n        \"Mm-hmm.\" Jiang Nansheng nodded, pulling a stack of documents from the drawer beneath the TV cabinet and tossing them to her.\n\n        \"Fu Media has been doing well financially over the past three years. Aside from investing in stocks and funds, Fu Mingcheng has also purchased several properties. Not long ago, he even bought a luxury downtown apartment for Song Zhiyi's parents. Payment records and copies of the purchase invoices are all in there.\"\n\n        Lin Shu looked at the property deed in her hand and couldn't help but laugh. That down-and-out scion who had once struggled to pay bank interest was now splurging on a home for his mistress's parents.\n\n        \"What about Song Zhiyi?\"\n\n        \"Her parents are just ordinary people. She gained minor fame online from a few short videos she made in college, which landed her a contract with Fu Media. She's built this whole 'humble but determined' persona, and Fu Mingcheng totally buys into it‚Äîplaying the hero who saves the damsel in distress.\"\n\n        Jiang Nansheng sneered.\n\n        Lin Shu flipped through the private investigator's findings: photos of Fu Mingcheng escorting Song Zhiyi down red carpets, visiting her on set, even records of them checking into hotels together.\n\n        Fu Mingcheng's marital infidelity was practically undeniable. Even if she couldn‚Äôt strip him of everything in the divorce, she‚Äôd still have the upper hand in asset division.\n\n        \"There's something even more interesting. Song Zhiyi's father was jailed three years ago for a fatal hit-and-run and was only recently released. The man he killed? Fu Mingcheng's father.\"\n\n        \"What? Does Fu Mingcheng know?\" Lin Shu nearly dropped her jaw in shock.\n\n        \"Probably not. If he did, his dad would claw his way out of the urn just to strangle his unfilial son.\" Jiang Nansheng smirked, clearly enjoying the irony.\n\n        Just then, the doorbell rang.\n\n        \"You expecting someone?\" Lin Shu asked.\n\n        \"Not my guest‚Äîyours. Han Ming, the big-shot lawyer.\"\n\n        \"You‚Äôve gotten so powerful you can summon *him* now?\" Lin Shu couldn‚Äôt hide her disbelief.\n\n        Han Ming was the legal counsel for the Gu conglomerate, a top-tier attorney with an unbeaten record. His consultation fees started at four figures per minute.\n\n        \"Me? No way. The Young Master personally arranged it.\" Jiang Nansheng shot Lin Shu a knowing look.\n\n        The Lin and Gu families had once been close. Lin Shu and Gu Huaiming, the heir to the Gu empire, had practically grown up together. Three years ago, when Lin Shu decided to accompany Fu Mingcheng's mother abroad, Gu Huaiming had been vehemently opposed.\n\n        *\"Lin Shu, are you really this desperate?\"*\n\n        They‚Äôd fought, parted on bad terms, and hadn‚Äôt spoken once in the three years since.\n\n        \"He‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt angry with me anymore?\" Lin Shu‚Äôs expression froze for a second, her almond-shaped eyes flickering.\n\n        \"How could he ever *really* be angry with you?\" Jiang Nansheng sighed, patting her shoulder.\n\n        The door opened, and Han Ming stepped in.\n\n        He looked to be in his early forties, impeccably dressed in a suit, briefcase in hand, with an assistant trailing behind.\n\n        \"Ms. Lin Shu, hello. I‚Äôm Han Ming, your legal counsel. From this moment forward, I‚Äôll be handling your case.\"\n\n        \"Thank you for your time.\" Lin Shu shook his hand politely, then handed him Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs divorce agreement.\n\n        Jiang Nansheng leaned in to skim it. When she saw the clause where Fu Mingcheng offered Lin Shu a mere 10% of Fu Media‚Äôs shares as settlement, she let out an incredulous laugh.\n\n        \"If you hadn‚Äôt poured money and resources into Fu Media back then, it would‚Äôve gone bankrupt ages ago. How dare he offer you just 10%? Is he treating you like a beggar?\"\n\n        Han Ming finished reviewing the agreement without comment, his tone professional and unreadable.\n\n        \"My assistant has already gathered evidence of Mr. Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs infidelity and a detailed list of his assets. Ms. Lin, please let me know what you‚Äôre seeking in this divorce.\"\n\n        \"I‚Äôll accept the loss‚Äîthe marriage is over. But I want every cent that belongs to me.\"\n\n        \"Since you and Mr. Fu didn‚Äôt sign a prenup, the case is somewhat complex. But rest assured, I‚Äôll do everything to protect your legal interests.\"\n\n        Lin Shu nodded weakly. She hadn‚Äôt signed a prenup out of trust for Fu Mingcheng. Now she knew: every tear shed in marriage was the result of the water in your brain before the wedding.\n\n        \"Ms. Lin, is there anything else I can assist you with today?\" Han Ming glanced at his watch‚Äîhis time was clearly precious.\n\n        \"Actually, I‚Äôd like you to accompany me to the Fu residence. I need to reclaim the house.\"\n\n        Lin Shu pulled the property deed from her suitcase. After verifying its authenticity, Han Ming escorted her to the Fu family home.\n\n        When they arrived, Song Zhiyi was already there, sitting cozily with the family over dinner.\n\n        \"Zhiyi, try this. Mom specifically asked the maid to make ginseng black chicken soup for you,\" Fu Xiaoran said, ladling a bowl for her.\n\n        \"Thank you, Auntie.\" Song Zhiyi took a small sip.\n\n        \"Don‚Äôt mention it. We‚Äôre family now‚Äîno need for formalities.\" Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs mother smiled warmly.\n\n        \"Zhiyi, since you‚Äôve already accepted my brother‚Äôs proposal, shouldn‚Äôt I start calling you sister-in-law?\" Fu Xiaoran teased, batting her lashes.\n\n        \"Your sister-in-law is still technically Lin Shu,\" Song Zhiyi replied pointedly, shooting Fu Mingcheng a sidelong glance.\n\n        \"Lin Shu and I only signed a marriage certificate‚Äîwe‚Äôve never even shared a bed.\" Fu Mingcheng grabbed Song Zhiyi‚Äôs hand, eager to prove his loyalty. \"Zhiyi, you‚Äôre carrying my child. Don‚Äôt overthink this. You‚Äôre the only one in my heart.\"\n\n        \"Lin Shu? She was just a glorified nurse for Mom,\" Fu Xiaoran chimed in.\n\n        \"She did take care of your mother for three years. Even if she didn‚Äôt do much, she put in the effort,\" Song Zhiyi said dismissively, her tone dripping with condescension.\n\n        \"She hasn‚Äôt worked a day in years‚Äîliving off my brother the whole time. And now he‚Äôs giving her 10% of the company in the divorce? What a joke! That money could hire a hundred nurses!\"\n\n        Fu Xiaoran was fuming.\n\n        Just then, Lin Shu walked in with her entourage.\n\n        The moment Lin Shu had moved out, Song Zhiyi had moved in. Now, with Lin Shu‚Äôs return, the air turned thick with tension.\n\n        \"Couldn‚Äôt stay away, huh? Too bad‚Äîthere‚Äôs no place for you here anymore,\" Fu Xiaoran mocked.\n\n        \"Xiao Shu, we have guests today. This really isn‚Äôt the time. If you have something to discuss with Mingcheng, can it wait?\" Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs mother added, playing the mediator.\n\n        The mother-daughter duo was at it again‚Äîone harsh, one \"reasonable.\"\n\n        Lin Shu had no patience for their act. She turned to Han Ming.\n\n        Han Ming stepped forward, holding up the property deed.\n\n        \"I am Ms. Lin Shu‚Äôs legal representative. This villa at 208 Xijiang Road is her private property. You are to vacate the premises immediately. Otherwise, I will have no choice but to involve the police. For your information, unlawful occupation of a residence is a criminal offense punishable by up to three years in prison or detention.\"\n\n        The villa *was* legally under Lin Shu‚Äôs name. The Fu family had no defense.\n\n        Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs face darkened.\n\n        His mother shook her head, sighing. \"Xiao Shu, don‚Äôt be childish. We‚Äôre family‚Äîcan‚Äôt we talk this out? Must you bring lawyers into it?\"        \"Were you two really that close before? You actually gave her an entire villa.\" Song Zhiyi turned to Fu Mingcheng with a sour tone.\n\n        Since Fu Mingcheng had recently gifted her parents a luxury apartment, she instinctively assumed that the property deed in Lin Shu's hands was also from him.\n\n        Lin Shu couldn't be bothered to explain and simply said to Han Ming, \"Call the police.\"\n\n        \"Wait!\" Song Zhiyi was the first to object. As a famous actress, if the situation escalated after calling the police, she would suffer the most damage.\n\n        \"Lin Shu, can we talk for a moment?\" Song Zhiyi looked at her.\n\n        Lin Shu glanced at Song Zhiyi indifferently.\n\n        This was her first time seeing Song Zhiyi in person. With a short bob, dressed in a white blouse and a fitted skirt, her looks were merely above average‚Äînothing outstanding in an industry filled with beauties. But her demeanor was refined, and the roles she played were always striking and charismatic.\n\n        Standing beside Fu Mingcheng, her hand tightly clasped in his, her slightly raised chin exuded arrogance. To be so brazen as a mistress‚Äîtruly unmatched.\n\n        \"I have nothing to say to a homewrecker,\" Lin Shu retorted bluntly.\n\n        \"Lin Shu, I‚Äôm speaking to you politely. Your attitude makes you seem utterly uncivilized.\"\n\n        Song Zhiyi frowned, visibly displeased. \"I know you‚Äôre resentful, but love can‚Äôt be forced. Continuing like this will only humiliate you further. Besides, Mingcheng has already given you 10% of his company‚Äôs shares as compensation. Fu Media is now worth over a billion‚Äîhe hasn‚Äôt mistreated you. Take the money and leave with some dignity intact. If you get greedy, we won‚Äôt hold back either.\"\n\n        \"Finished?\" Lin Shu found it laughable. \"Is your father‚Äôs parenting‚Äîafter serving time in prison‚Äîteaching you to be a shameless mistress?!\"\n\n        \"What did you say? Who do you think you are to insult my father? Apologize. Apologize to me right now!\" Song Zhiyi seemed deeply offended, grabbing Lin Shu‚Äôs arm and hissing sharply.\n\n        \"Let go.\" Lin Shu had always disliked physical contact from strangers and shook her off impatiently.\n\n        Lin Shu hadn‚Äôt even used force, but Song Zhiyi let out a startled cry, staggering and collapsing to the ground. Clutching her stomach, she moaned in pain, \"It hurts‚Ä¶ my stomach!\"\n\n        \"Zhiyi!\" Fu Mingcheng panicked, scooping her up from the floor.\n\n        \"Mingcheng, save our baby‚Ä¶\" Song Zhiyi‚Äôs face was pale.\n\n        \"Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll take you to the hospital right now.\" Fu Mingcheng carried her out swiftly, pausing only to glare at Lin Shu. \"Lin Shu, you knew she was pregnant and still pushed her. When did you become so vicious?\"\n\n        Nestled in his arms, Song Zhiyi shot Lin Shu a triumphant look.\n\n        Lin Shu couldn‚Äôt help but sneer. \"No wonder you‚Äôre a top actress‚Äîsuch a performance.\"\n\n        \"Lin Shu, that‚Äôs enough!\" Fu Mingcheng looked utterly disappointed. \"If anything happens to Zhiyi or the baby, I won‚Äôt let you off!\"\n\n        Watching Fu Mingcheng carry Song Zhiyi away without a backward glance, Lin Shu had no time to grieve‚Äîthe police and moving crew arrived shortly after.\n\n        The officers sternly 'escorted' the Fu family out of the villa, while the movers unceremoniously tossed their belongings outside.\n\n        Madame Fu was so furious she nearly fainted, and Fu Xiaoran hopped around cursing. But no one paid them any attention.\n\n        The Fu family‚Äôs servants stood at the doorway, bewildered and lost.\n\n        \"You have thirty minutes to pack your things and leave,\" Lin Shu said coolly, unwilling to make things harder for them.\n\n        \"What about this month‚Äôs wages‚Ä¶?\" one servant dared to ask.\n\n        \"Ask whoever employed you. Understand?\" Lin Shu raised an eyebrow.\n\n        The servants nodded and scattered like startled birds.\n\n        Soon, the Fu family was gone, the servants had left, and even the police and movers departed. The sprawling villa fell into sudden silence.\n\n        Like a grand performance reaching its finale, she was left alone once more.\n\n        \"Xiao Shu, are‚Ä¶ are you okay?\" Jiang Nansheng stepped inside, concern in her voice.\n\n        \"Why wouldn‚Äôt I be? They‚Äôre the ones who should be worried.\" Lin Shu tilted her head back, forcing the welling tears to retreat.\n\n        Crying over someone unworthy made those tears worthless.\n\n        \"Tell Attorney Han to draft a new divorce agreement. I want 51% of Fu Media‚Äôs shares.\"\n\n        If love couldn‚Äôt be relied on, then money would have to do.\n\n        ---\n\n        Meanwhile, at City Hospital.\n\n        The doctor conducted a full examination of Song Zhiyi‚Äîeverything was normal.\n\n        But with her tear-streaked face, the physician couldn‚Äôt outright call it an act. Prescribing some prenatal supplements, they advised her to stay for observation.\n\n        In the hospital room.\n\n        Song Zhiyi leaned against Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs chest, still sniffling pitifully.\n\n        \"Thank goodness the baby‚Äôs fine. Otherwise, I‚Äôd regret it for life. I thought your wife, coming from an elite family, would be understanding of our feelings. I never imagined she‚Äôd resent even my unborn child. If she hates me, fine. But the baby is innocent.\"\n\n        \"I didn‚Äôt expect her jealousy to go this far either,\" Fu Mingcheng sighed, frowning. \"I‚Äôll finalize the divorce soon. She won‚Äôt get another chance to hurt you.\"\n\n        \"Mmm, I trust you.\" Song Zhiyi shyly lifted her chin, pressing her lips to his.\n\n        \"Ms. Song, your IV drip is finished. Let me remove the needle‚Äîoh, sorry.\" A nurse walked in just as they kissed.\n\n        \"It‚Äôs fine.\" Blushing, Song Zhiyi extended her arm with the IV.\n\n        The nurse removed the needle and discreetly left.\n\n        Back at the station, the young nurse buzzed with excitement, gossiping with colleagues.\n\n        \"Patient in Bed 16 is actually the celebrity Song Zhiyi! This is my first time seeing a star in person. She‚Äôs so pretty!\"\n\n        \"Song Zhiyi‚Äôs just average. You should‚Äôve seen Lin Shu back in the day‚Äîone smile could topple cities, another could conquer nations. Too bad she retired,\" another nurse remarked.\n\n        \"The man with her is the CEO of Fu Media, right? Tall, handsome, loaded‚ÄîSong Zhiyi‚Äôs living the dream. So enviable‚Ä¶\"\n\n        The nurse‚Äôs eyes sparkled with admiration, but before she could finish, the head nurse strode in.\n\n        \"Finished with your duties? Chatting on the clock?\"\n\n        The lively station fell silent. Head Nurse Yin said nothing else, stepping out coldly to make a call.\n\n        \"President Chen, Fu Mingcheng brought a pregnant woman to the hospital for prenatal care. Seems the rumors online are true.\"\n\n        \"I see.\" President Chen‚Äôs voice was heavy. After hanging up, he pondered before dialing Lin Shu‚Äôs number.\n\n        \"Uncle Chen.\"\n\n        \"Xiao Shu, Nurse Yin told me Fu Mingcheng accompanied a woman for prenatal care today. And then there‚Äôs the online news about him proposing to that actress‚Äîwhat‚Äôs going on?\" President Chen asked.\n\n        \"Yes, he‚Äôs in love with someone else. We‚Äôre negotiating the divorce,\" Lin Shu answered truthfully.\n\n        \"*Sigh*. I thought Fu Mingcheng was a decent man. Turns out he‚Äôs fickle. What a waste of your three years together. Don‚Äôt take it too hard, Xiao Shu. Quick marriages and divorces are common these days. What‚Äôs that phrase you youngsters say? 'If it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs over‚Äîthe next one will be better.'\"        After listening, Lin Shu couldn't help but smile.\n\n        Uncle Chen was a man devoted to academia, not one skilled in comforting others. It was quite an effort for him to say these words.\n\n        \"There's no need to worry about me, I'm fine. It's just that these three years have caused you a lot of trouble.\"\n\n        Aunt Fu's illness had always been under President Chen's care, and it was also President Chen who pulled strings to help arrange treatment at a hospital abroad.\n\n        \"Don't speak to Uncle Chen so formally. If your grandfather hadn‚Äôt funded me back then, I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today. Both your grandfather and your mother are gone‚Äîit‚Äôs only right for me to look after you.\"\n\n        \"Thank you, Uncle Chen.\" Aside from gratitude, Lin Shu didn‚Äôt know what else to say.\n\n        There were so many people in the world who understood gratitude‚Äîit was a shame she had misjudged the one she shouldn‚Äôt have.\n\n        ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\n\n        Fu Mingcheng had stayed at the hospital accompanying Song Zhiyi all night and only returned home the next day.\n\n        Madam Fu and Fu Xiaoran had already moved into Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs downtown apartment. With only one night to settle in, the place was still a mess, unpacked and disorganized.\n\n        \"I know Lin Shu can‚Äôt bear to leave you. I had originally intended to keep a place for her in the Fu family out of consideration for the three years she cared for me. But I never expected her to be so scheming, resorting to these underhanded tactics. The Fu family has no room for her anymore. Mingcheng, you must finalize the divorce as soon as possible.\"\n\n        Madam Fu clutched her chest, looking utterly heartbroken.\n\n        \"Yes, I understand.\" Fu Mingcheng replied with a grim expression, trying to console her. \"Mother, don‚Äôt be angry. It‚Äôs not worth ruining your health over Lin Shu.\"\n\n        \"How can I not be angry? I‚Äôm furious!\" Madam Fu‚Äôs health had never been robust, and after the day‚Äôs agitation, she indeed felt unwell. Instinctively, she said, \"I‚Äôm not feeling well. Tomorrow, have Lin Shu accompany me‚Äîno, never mind. Tomorrow, let Xiaoran take me to the hospital.\"\n\n        The next day, Fu Xiaoran accompanied Madam Fu to the city hospital.\n\n        As usual, they took the elevator directly upstairs and sought out Head Nurse Yin.\n\n        \"Head Nurse Yin, my mother isn‚Äôt feeling well. Have President Chen examine her,\" Fu Xiaoran demanded imperiously, standing in front of the nurse‚Äôs station in her sky-high heels.\n\n        \"President Chen is with another patient. He‚Äôs unavailable,\" Head Nurse Yin replied, her attitude noticeably colder than before, almost dismissive.\n\n        \"What patient could be more important than my mother? Every time we came before, President Chen would see us immediately!\"\n\n        \"Before was before. Now is now.\" Head Nurse Yin gave her a cold glance. \"Before, it was out of consideration for Lin Shu. Now that she‚Äôs divorcing your brother, why should President Chen continue giving you special treatment?\"\n\n        After saying this, Head Nurse Yin impatiently gestured toward the elevator. \"Don‚Äôt waste my time here. If you want to see a doctor, go to the outpatient department and queue like everyone else.\"\n\n        \"You‚Äîjust wait and see!\" Fu Xiaoran spat out a meaningless threat, but in the end, she still had to take Madam Fu to the outpatient clinic.\n\n        The specialist appointments were fully booked, and the general queue would take over two hours.\n\n        Upon hearing this, Madam Fu was so furious she nearly fainted.\n\n        \"That little wretch Lin Shu‚Äîshe must have done this on purpose! Call your brother right now. He needs to see exactly what kind of woman he married!\"\n\n        When Fu Mingcheng received his sister‚Äôs call, he was in the middle of a company meeting.\n\n        Over the years, Lin Shu had taken full responsibility for his mother‚Äôs medical care‚Äîdoctors, prescriptions, everything. He had never been involved and never needed to worry.\n\n        Now, hearing his sister accuse Lin Shu of instructing doctors to refuse his mother treatment, he was equally furious.\n\n        Unable to focus on the meeting, he dialed Lin Shu‚Äôs number.\n\n        \"Where are you?\"\n\n        \"Nansheng‚Äôs apartment.\"\n\n        \"We need to talk.\" Fu Mingcheng suppressed his anger.\n\n        \"Fine.\" Lin Shu‚Äôs reply was indifferent.\n\n        Lin Shu didn‚Äôt have many friends, so Fu Mingcheng knew Jiang Nansheng‚Äôs address and drove straight there.\n\n        In the years since marrying Fu Mingcheng, Lin Shu had been constantly busy caring for Madam Fu. Rarely did she have such leisurely moments. Now, she sat by the floor-to-ceiling window brewing Gongfu tea, the fading sunlight casting a glow over her, making her seem radiant.\n\n        When Fu Mingcheng stormed in and saw Lin Shu leisurely sipping tea, his fury only grew.\n\n        \"Lin Shu, don‚Äôt go too far. Having President Chen refuse treatment for Mother‚Äîare you trying to kill her? She let you call her ‚ÄòMother‚Äô for three years. How can you be so cruel?\"\n\n        \"President Chen refused to treat your mother?\" Lin Shu was momentarily taken aback, but then it made sense. President Chen was a top-tier specialist in the country, with countless patients waiting for his attention. If not for her, why would he ever spare time for the Fu family?\n\n        \"Lin Shu, stop pretending. Wasn‚Äôt this your doing?\" Fu Mingcheng said coldly.\n\n        Lin Shu took a sip of tea. Perhaps her tea-brewing skills had declined‚Äîthe taste was unusually bitter.\n\n        \"If President Chen won‚Äôt treat her, aren‚Äôt there other doctors? The country isn‚Äôt short of renowned nephrologists. If necessary, you can go abroad. We‚Äôre getting divorced‚Äîdo you really think it‚Äôs appropriate to keep using my connections for favors?\"\n\n        Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs handsome face darkened. Though Lin Shu‚Äôs words weren‚Äôt wrong, he still found her utterly heartless.\n\n        \"All these years, Mother treated you like her own daughter. I can‚Äôt believe it was wasted on you.\" Fu Mingcheng turned to leave, but Lin Shu stopped him.\n\n        \"Since you‚Äôre here, you might as well sign the divorce papers.\" Lin Shu set down her cup and slid the newly drafted divorce agreement toward him.\n\n        Fu Mingcheng skimmed through it before tossing it back onto the table with a sneer.\n\n        \"First, you have President Chen refuse Mother‚Äôs treatment. Now, you demand over half the company‚Äôs shares. Do you really think these underhanded tricks will make me change my mind? Let me be clear‚ÄîI will never give up Zhiyi. These tactics only disgust me.\"\n\n        Lin Shu looked at him, feeling a rare moment of shared understanding. Right now, she too felt disgusted‚Äîdeeply disgusted.\n\n        \"Fu Mingcheng, narcissism is an illness. You should get that treated.\"\n\n        \"Hah.\" Fu Mingcheng scoffed. \"Lin Shu, asking for 51% of Fu Media‚Äôs shares is pure delusion.\"\n\n        \"Without me, Fu Media would have gone bankrupt long ago. Strictly from a business standpoint, 51% isn‚Äôt unreasonable.\"\n\n        \"51% would mean Fu Media becomes the Lin family‚Äôs. I‚Äôll never agree.\"\n\n        \"Suit yourself.\" Lin Shu shrugged indifferently. \"Then we‚Äôll settle it in court. I hear divorce lawsuits can drag on for a year or more. I can wait‚Äîbut can you? In a few months, Song Zhiyi‚Äôs belly will start showing. Wedding dresses won‚Äôt look so flattering then, will they?\"\n\n        Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs face turned livid, the divorce agreement crumpling in his grip. After a long, icy glare, he stormed out.\n\n        Only after he left did Jiang Nansheng come downstairs, spitting in the direction of his departure before turning to Lin Shu.\n\n        \"You really plan to drag this out for a year?\"\n\n        \"Like I have time for that.\" Lin Shu picked up the purple clay teapot with her jade-like fingers, pouring another cup as she spoke. \"Find some reliable journalists. Let‚Äôs expose Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs marital status. What right does a cheating husband have to play the devoted lover in public?\"",

        "primary_text": "For three long years, Lin Shu had yearned day and night to return home and reunite with Fu Mingcheng. Yet she never imagined that on her very first day back, she would be greeted with divorce papers.\n\n        \"Divorce? This joke isn‚Äôt funny at all.\"\n\n        Lin Shu looked at the man sitting across from her. Dressed in a tailored black suit, he was as aloof and dignified as ever. It was the same face she had dreamed of for years, yet now it felt utterly unfamiliar.\n\n        \"I‚Äôm busy and don‚Äôt have time for jokes. Read the divorce agreement. If there are no issues, sign it,\" Fu Mingcheng replied coldly.\n\n        \"Can I at least know why?\" Lin Shu‚Äôs voice trembled.\n\n        \"Lin Shu, you left for three years. During that time, it was Zhiyi who stood by my side. We supported each other, and that‚Äôs how Fu Media reached where it is today. I don‚Äôt want to let her down.\"\n\n        \"So you‚Äôd rather let *me* down? Fu Mingcheng, did I *choose* to leave you for three years? I was taking care of your mother!\"\n\n        Three years ago, just after they had registered their marriage but before their wedding, Fu‚Äôs mother was diagnosed with kidney failure. With no suitable donor available domestically, the only option was treatment abroad. Lin Shu had spent those three years nursing her mother-in-law back to health, only to return and face Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs betrayal.\n\n        \"Mingcheng, do you remember what you said when you proposed to me?\"\n\n        Three years ago, Fu Mingcheng had knelt before her with a diamond ring, gazing into her eyes with sincerity. He had said, *\"Xiao Shu, give me the chance to be your partner and family. I‚Äôll stay by your side forever, cherish you, and love you‚Äîeven if the seas run dry and the rocks crumble to dust.\"*\n\n        Moved by his words, Lin Shu had willingly given up her flourishing career to care for his mother abroad. But now, though his vows still echoed in her ears, the man who had made them had given his heart to someone else.\n\n        \"I truly cared for you back then. But affection isn‚Äôt the same as love.\" A flicker of guilt finally surfaced in Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs cold eyes.\n\n        \"It wasn‚Äôt until I met Zhiyi that I understood what real love is. She‚Äôs nothing like you‚Äîshe isn‚Äôt some fragile vine that clings to a man for support. She‚Äôs a kapok tree, standing tall through storms. Despite her humble background, she‚Äôs resilient and hardworking. Under the spotlight, she shines so brilliantly‚Äîhow could I not be drawn to her...?\"\n\n        Lin Shu had no interest in hearing about his affair. She cut him off with a bitter laugh.\n\n        \"She *shines*? She *drew you in*? Fu Mingcheng, have you forgotten? Before I married you, I was already the Golden Elephant Award‚Äôs Best Actress. I gave up my career *for you*.\"\n\n        \"I never forced you. That was your choice.\"\n\n        His words left her stunned.\n\n        \"Have you even discussed this divorce with your mother? She‚Äôd never agree to it.\" Lin Shu clenched her fists, forcing back tears.\n\n        \"Mom has already met Zhiyi. She‚Äôs gentle and clever‚ÄîMom adores her. Besides, Zhiyi is pregnant with my child. Mom is about to have a grandchild. Why would she object?\"\n\n        So, his entire family was content‚Äîonly she remained as the inconvenient obstacle.\n\n        Lin Shu felt as if something had pierced her heart, the pain stealing her breath.\n\n        For three years, she had cared for Fu‚Äôs mother single-handedly, feeding her, tending to her needs day and night‚Äîall because Fu‚Äôs mother disliked the impersonal touch of hired nurses.\n\n        Now that the old woman had recovered, it was time to discard the tool that had served its purpose.\n\n        Silence stretched between them.\n\n        Then, Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs phone buzzed on the table. Lin Shu caught the caller ID: *Zhiyi, my love*.\n\n        He picked up and stepped onto the balcony. Though she couldn‚Äôt hear his words, the tenderness on his face was one she hadn‚Äôt seen in years.\n\n        When he returned, his impatience was palpable. \"Lin Shu, I‚Äôve wronged you, and I‚Äôve made compensations in the divorce agreement. Let‚Äôs part amicably. Dragging this out will only humiliate you further.\"\n\n        With that, he stood and left.\n\n        The slam of the door reverberated through her chest, a dull, suffocating ache.\n\n        Lin Shu stared blankly at the divorce papers, her mind numb‚Äîuntil Wu Ma, her childhood nanny and the only person left who truly cared for her, entered the room.\n\n        \"Xiao Shu, are you alright?\" Wu Ma asked, her eyes full of worry.\n\n        \"Wu Ma...\" Lin Shu buried her face in the older woman‚Äôs embrace, tears finally spilling over. \"Wu Ma, am I a fool?\"\n\n        \"You silly child. I warned you long ago that these charity marriages come with risks. If the man has a conscience, you‚Äôre lucky. If not, you‚Äôre left swallowing blood with your broken teeth,\" Wu Ma sighed.\n\n        Three years ago, after Fu‚Äôs father died unexpectedly, the family‚Äôs financial chain collapsed, pushing them to the brink of bankruptcy. Lin Shu had used her late mother‚Äôs savings to bail them out. She then devoted three years abroad to caring for Fu‚Äôs mother so Fu Mingcheng could focus on rebuilding his career without distractions.\n\n        She had believed that as his wife, it was her duty to support his ambitions and tend to his family‚Äîso they could walk through life together.\n\n        Yet in the end, all her sacrifices had been nothing but her own delusion.\n\n        After crying, Lin Shu quickly wiped her tears and steeled herself.\n\n        She picked up her phone and dialed Jiang Nansheng, her best friend and former agent.\n\n        \"Nansheng, investigate all of Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs assets, as well as his relationship with Song Zhiyi over the past three years. Also, find me a reliable lawyer. I want a divorce.\"\n\n        There was a pause before Jiang Nansheng asked, \"Are you sure?\"\n\n        \"Yes.\"\n\n        \"Alright. Wait for my update.\"\n\n        After hanging up, Lin Shu noticed Wu Ma‚Äôs troubled expression.\n\n        \"Wu Ma, don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs just a divorce‚Äînot the end of the world.\"\n\n        \"Miss, marriage isn‚Äôt a game. Are you certain about this?\"\n\n        \"Yes,\" Lin Shu answered without hesitation. \"I slaved away overseas for his mother while he fooled around here, even knocking someone up. A man that filthy isn‚Äôt worth keeping.\"\n\n        \"But‚Äî\" Before Wu Ma could protest further, the door swung open. Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs younger sister, Fu Xiaoran, barged in unannounced.\n\n        \"Mom wants to see you,\" she announced haughtily.\n\n        \"Madam Fu must want to stop the divorce. Miss, she‚Äôs always favored you‚Äîyou must talk to her properly. If she persuades Mingcheng, he‚Äôll listen. He‚Äôs always been filial,\" Wu Ma urged, gripping Lin Shu‚Äôs hand. As someone of the older generation, she saw divorce as an earth-shattering matter.\n\n        Lin Shu pressed her lips together, her gaze dark and unreadable.\n\n        Fu Xiaoran scoffed. \"Figures you‚Äôd cling shamelessly to stay.\"\n\n        Ignoring the jab, Lin Shu followed her to Fu‚Äôs mother‚Äôs room.\n\n        The older woman sat on the bed, eyes red as if she‚Äôd been crying.\n\n        \"Xiao Shu...\" Fu‚Äôs mother choked out, grasping Lin Shu‚Äôs hands. \"That wretched son of mine hid this from me‚Äîit‚Äôs my fault for failing to raise him right. Our Fu family has wronged you. But Song Zhiyi is already pregnant... Mingcheng has no choice but to marry her.\"        Madame Fu held Lin Shu in her arms, coddling her like precious treasure. \"Xiao Shu, Mom knows you love Mingcheng and can't bear to be without him. Honestly, a marriage certificate is just a piece of paper‚Äîit doesn't really matter. Even if you and Mingcheng go through with the divorce, you can still stay in the Fu family. I only recognize you as my daughter-in-law.\"\n\n        Lin Shu had clung to a sliver of hope until now. After all, these past three years abroad, she and Madame Fu had relied on each other for survival. She had devoted herself to caring for the older woman, and Madame Fu had treated her with affection and concern‚Äîjust like a real mother and daughter.\n\n        Yet at this moment, the last remnants of her attachment to the Fu family evaporated.\n\n        \"So what you're saying is, you want me to become Fu Mingcheng's mistress after the divorce?\"\n\n        \"Xiao Shu, listen to Mom‚Äîdon't place so much importance on that piece of paper,\" Madame Fu said earnestly.\n\n        \"If a marriage certificate is so insignificant, why does Fu Mingcheng insist on divorcing me? Why can't Song Zhiyi just be his little mistress then?\"\n\n        \"Zhiyi-jie is a rising star‚Äîthe top actress at Fu Media. How could she ever be some secret mistress?\" Fu Xiaoran cut in impatiently.\n\n        Having studied domestically all this time, she was quite close with Song Zhiyi and had little affection for her actual sister-in-law, Lin Shu.\n\n        \"Song Zhiyi knew full well Fu Mingcheng was a married man, yet she still fooled around with him. She was a shameless mistress from the very beginning,\" Lin Shu retorted disdainfully.\n\n        \"You‚Äî!\" Fu Xiaoran's eyes flashed with anger, but before she could speak, Madame Fu interrupted.\n\n        \"Enough, don't make things worse,\" Madame Fu scolded her daughter half-heartedly before turning back to Lin Shu with a sigh. \"Xiao Shu, you know how it is‚ÄîZhiyi is currently the top star at Fu Media. The entire company relies on her. She refuses to stay in the shadows, so Mingcheng has no choice but to divorce you.\"\n\n        Finally, Lin Shu understood. Song Zhiyi was now a popular actress‚ÄîFu Media's top star who could bring the Fu family greater benefits. Meanwhile, she, the neglected wife, had long outlived her usefulness.\n\n        \"How is there no choice? Back when Fu Mingcheng didn't want me to go abroad with you, you cried, made a scene, and even threatened to kill yourself until he finally gave in. Why can't you do the same now?\"\n\n        Back then, she and Fu Mingcheng had just gotten married‚Äîstill in the honeymoon phase. Naturally, he hadn't wanted to be separated from her. But Madame Fu, unwilling to go abroad alone, had cried, made scenes, and even refused treatment, threatening suicide until Fu Mingcheng had no choice but to agree.\n\n        \"Lin Shu, who do you think you are, making Mom pressure my brother like this?\" Fu Xiaoran lashed out, hands on her hips.\n\n        Right‚Äîwhen it came to their own interests, they would stop at nothing. But for others? Not worth the effort. Lin Shu could only blame herself for being blind. She had actually believed the Fu family was kind and virtuous‚Äîgood people.\n\n        \"You two keep switching between good cop and bad cop‚Äîall just to kick me out. Fine. I agree to the divorce,\" she said wearily.\n\n        \"Hmph, at least you know what's good for you,\" Fu Xiaoran sneered, tilting her chin up. \"Then hurry up and move out. I'll give you one day‚Äîdon't even think about lingering.\"\n\n        \"Xiao Shu, Mom really doesn't want to let you go. I just... have no choice.\" Madame Fu clutched Lin Shu's hand while pressing the other to her chest, looking utterly heartbroken.\n\n        \"Madame Fu, this mother-daughter act of ours has run its course. Overdoing it just makes it tiresome,\" Lin Shu said coldly, shaking off her hand. She looked between the two women. \"I'll give you one day to move out. From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.\"\n\n        \"Lin Shu, have you lost your mind? This was my father's house‚ÄîFu family property! How dare you tell us to leave?\"\n\n        \"This villa was indeed purchased by your father before his death. But after he passed, the Fu family went bankrupt, and this house was auctioned off. If I hadn't bought it, you would've been homeless long ago. Now, get out of my villa‚Äîor I'll call the police for trespassing.\"\n\n        Lin Shu had no patience left for the Fu women. After delivering her ultimatum, she turned and left.\n\n        \"Mom, did you see how arrogant she was?\" Fu Xiaoran fumed, jabbing a finger toward the door.\n\n        \"Enough‚Äîwhy bother with her? Your brother already wrote in the divorce agreement that he'd give her a property as compensation. If she wants this villa so badly, let her have it. Mingcheng owns plenty of estates‚Äîmany better than this. It's not like we'll have nowhere to stay.\"\n\n        No sooner had Madame Fu finished speaking than a knock came at the door. A maid entered and said, \"Madame, the young mistress just left with her suitcase.\"\n\n        \"Left?\" Madame Fu was taken aback.\n\n        \"Thought she was so tough, but in the end, she still slunk away with her tail between her legs,\" Fu Xiaoran scoffed.\n\n        \"Lin Shu must've regretted speaking so harshly to us and left on her own. She's utterly devoted to your brother‚Äîotherwise, she wouldn't have waited on me so diligently these past three years. Once she comes to her senses in a few days and returns, be a little kinder to her. She's quite good at taking care of people. With her looking after me, you and your brother can focus on your careers without worries.\"\n\n        \"Fine. If she knows her place, I'll be nicer,\" Fu Xiaoran muttered reluctantly.\n\n        \"Where's your brother?\" Madame Fu asked.\n\n        \"He went out. Tonight, he's proposing to Zhiyi-jie‚Äîhe booked out an entire riverside hotel and arranged fireworks over the river.\"\n\n        \"Such a waste of money for all that show. When he proposed to Lin Shu, a simple ceremony was just fine.\" Madame Fu clearly disapproved, but remembering her new daughter-in-law's status as a top actress, she didn't press further.\n\n        ‚Ä¶\n\n        Lin Shu packed some essentials and, after leaving the Fu residence, went straight to Jiang Nansheng's apartment.\n\n        \"You're here so late‚Äîdid something happen?\" Jiang Nansheng opened the door to find Lin Shu perched on her suitcase outside. Her hair was tied in a ponytail, and she wore a simple T-shirt and jeans. Her large, moist eyes were slightly red at the corners, making her look like an abandoned little rabbit‚Äîpitiful and lost.\n\n        \"The Fu household was too depressing, so I'm staying with you for a couple of days,\" Lin Shu said with a shrug, dragging her suitcase inside.\n\n        Jiang Nansheng hastily tidied up the guest room. Seeing Lin Shu's pallor, she urged her to rest first.\n\n        Having just returned to the country, Lin Shu was still jet-lagged. She slept fitfully through the night and only learned the next morning that Fu Mingcheng had set off fireworks along the riverbank all night for Song Zhiyi‚Äîa spectacle that rocketed to the top of trending searches.\n\n        The love story between the domineering CEO and the popular star force-fed the public with sweetness. Soon after, Song Zhiyi's official account posted a prenatal exam slip, confirming they already had a \"love child\" on the way.\n\n        Since Lin Shu and Fu Mingcheng had only registered their marriage without holding a ceremony, only close friends and family knew of their relationship. To the public, Fu Mingcheng remained the golden bachelor‚Äîhis pairing with Song Zhiyi a match made in heaven.\n\n        \"That bastard Fu Mingcheng! When he proposed to you, he was so stingy‚Äîjust flowers and a ring, reeking of poverty. And you, the hopeless romantic, were moved to tears. Now he's splurging for another woman.\"\n\n        Jiang Nansheng was so furious after seeing the news that she skipped breakfast.\n\n        Lin Shu, however, never neglected her stomach. She sipped slowly from her bowl of congee. Yet despite the seafood congee's usual savory richness, it tasted strangely bitter now.\n\n        Back when she and Fu Mingcheng were together, the Fu family was on the brink of bankruptcy. All he had to offer was his sincerity‚Äîand Lin Shu had accepted it.\n\n        Now, with Fu Media thriving, spending millions in a single night to win a beauty's smile was simply the extravagance befitting President Fu.\n\n        \"Eating? How can you still eat? Aren't you angry at all?\" Jiang Nansheng glared at Lin Shu's unhurried motions, her temper flaring again.\n\n        \"Why should I be? Every cent he's burning now is from our shared marital assets. I'll make sure he returns every last penny.\"        Lin Shu set down her spoon, dabbed the corners of her lips with a soft tissue, and asked, \"Have you found everything I wanted?\"\n\n        \"Mm-hmm.\" Jiang Nansheng nodded, pulling a stack of documents from the drawer beneath the TV cabinet and tossing them to her.\n\n        \"Fu Media has been doing well financially over the past three years. Aside from investing in stocks and funds, Fu Mingcheng has also purchased several properties. Not long ago, he even bought a luxury downtown apartment for Song Zhiyi's parents. Payment records and copies of the purchase invoices are all in there.\"\n\n        Lin Shu looked at the property deed in her hand and couldn't help but laugh. That down-and-out scion who had once struggled to pay bank interest was now splurging on a home for his mistress's parents.\n\n        \"What about Song Zhiyi?\"\n\n        \"Her parents are just ordinary people. She gained minor fame online from a few short videos she made in college, which landed her a contract with Fu Media. She's built this whole 'humble but determined' persona, and Fu Mingcheng totally buys into it‚Äîplaying the hero who saves the damsel in distress.\"\n\n        Jiang Nansheng sneered.\n\n        Lin Shu flipped through the private investigator's findings: photos of Fu Mingcheng escorting Song Zhiyi down red carpets, visiting her on set, even records of them checking into hotels together.\n\n        Fu Mingcheng's marital infidelity was practically undeniable. Even if she couldn‚Äôt strip him of everything in the divorce, she‚Äôd still have the upper hand in asset division.\n\n        \"There's something even more interesting. Song Zhiyi's father was jailed three years ago for a fatal hit-and-run and was only recently released. The man he killed? Fu Mingcheng's father.\"\n\n        \"What? Does Fu Mingcheng know?\" Lin Shu nearly dropped her jaw in shock.\n\n        \"Probably not. If he did, his dad would claw his way out of the urn just to strangle his unfilial son.\" Jiang Nansheng smirked, clearly enjoying the irony.\n\n        Just then, the doorbell rang.\n\n        \"You expecting someone?\" Lin Shu asked.\n\n        \"Not my guest‚Äîyours. Han Ming, the big-shot lawyer.\"\n\n        \"You‚Äôve gotten so powerful you can summon *him* now?\" Lin Shu couldn‚Äôt hide her disbelief.\n\n        Han Ming was the legal counsel for the Gu conglomerate, a top-tier attorney with an unbeaten record. His consultation fees started at four figures per minute.\n\n        \"Me? No way. The Young Master personally arranged it.\" Jiang Nansheng shot Lin Shu a knowing look.\n\n        The Lin and Gu families had once been close. Lin Shu and Gu Huaiming, the heir to the Gu empire, had practically grown up together. Three years ago, when Lin Shu decided to accompany Fu Mingcheng's mother abroad, Gu Huaiming had been vehemently opposed.\n\n        *\"Lin Shu, are you really this desperate?\"*\n\n        They‚Äôd fought, parted on bad terms, and hadn‚Äôt spoken once in the three years since.\n\n        \"He‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt angry with me anymore?\" Lin Shu‚Äôs expression froze for a second, her almond-shaped eyes flickering.\n\n        \"How could he ever *really* be angry with you?\" Jiang Nansheng sighed, patting her shoulder.\n\n        The door opened, and Han Ming stepped in.\n\n        He looked to be in his early forties, impeccably dressed in a suit, briefcase in hand, with an assistant trailing behind.\n\n        \"Ms. Lin Shu, hello. I‚Äôm Han Ming, your legal counsel. From this moment forward, I‚Äôll be handling your case.\"\n\n        \"Thank you for your time.\" Lin Shu shook his hand politely, then handed him Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs divorce agreement.\n\n        Jiang Nansheng leaned in to skim it. When she saw the clause where Fu Mingcheng offered Lin Shu a mere 10% of Fu Media‚Äôs shares as settlement, she let out an incredulous laugh.\n\n        \"If you hadn‚Äôt poured money and resources into Fu Media back then, it would‚Äôve gone bankrupt ages ago. How dare he offer you just 10%? Is he treating you like a beggar?\"\n\n        Han Ming finished reviewing the agreement without comment, his tone professional and unreadable.\n\n        \"My assistant has already gathered evidence of Mr. Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs infidelity and a detailed list of his assets. Ms. Lin, please let me know what you‚Äôre seeking in this divorce.\"\n\n        \"I‚Äôll accept the loss‚Äîthe marriage is over. But I want every cent that belongs to me.\"\n\n        \"Since you and Mr. Fu didn‚Äôt sign a prenup, the case is somewhat complex. But rest assured, I‚Äôll do everything to protect your legal interests.\"\n\n        Lin Shu nodded weakly. She hadn‚Äôt signed a prenup out of trust for Fu Mingcheng. Now she knew: every tear shed in marriage was the result of the water in your brain before the wedding.\n\n        \"Ms. Lin, is there anything else I can assist you with today?\" Han Ming glanced at his watch‚Äîhis time was clearly precious.\n\n        \"Actually, I‚Äôd like you to accompany me to the Fu residence. I need to reclaim the house.\"\n\n        Lin Shu pulled the property deed from her suitcase. After verifying its authenticity, Han Ming escorted her to the Fu family home.\n\n        When they arrived, Song Zhiyi was already there, sitting cozily with the family over dinner.\n\n        \"Zhiyi, try this. Mom specifically asked the maid to make ginseng black chicken soup for you,\" Fu Xiaoran said, ladling a bowl for her.\n\n        \"Thank you, Auntie.\" Song Zhiyi took a small sip.\n\n        \"Don‚Äôt mention it. We‚Äôre family now‚Äîno need for formalities.\" Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs mother smiled warmly.\n\n        \"Zhiyi, since you‚Äôve already accepted my brother‚Äôs proposal, shouldn‚Äôt I start calling you sister-in-law?\" Fu Xiaoran teased, batting her lashes.\n\n        \"Your sister-in-law is still technically Lin Shu,\" Song Zhiyi replied pointedly, shooting Fu Mingcheng a sidelong glance.\n\n        \"Lin Shu and I only signed a marriage certificate‚Äîwe‚Äôve never even shared a bed.\" Fu Mingcheng grabbed Song Zhiyi‚Äôs hand, eager to prove his loyalty. \"Zhiyi, you‚Äôre carrying my child. Don‚Äôt overthink this. You‚Äôre the only one in my heart.\"\n\n        \"Lin Shu? She was just a glorified nurse for Mom,\" Fu Xiaoran chimed in.\n\n        \"She did take care of your mother for three years. Even if she didn‚Äôt do much, she put in the effort,\" Song Zhiyi said dismissively, her tone dripping with condescension.\n\n        \"She hasn‚Äôt worked a day in years‚Äîliving off my brother the whole time. And now he‚Äôs giving her 10% of the company in the divorce? What a joke! That money could hire a hundred nurses!\"\n\n        Fu Xiaoran was fuming.\n\n        Just then, Lin Shu walked in with her entourage.\n\n        The moment Lin Shu had moved out, Song Zhiyi had moved in. Now, with Lin Shu‚Äôs return, the air turned thick with tension.\n\n        \"Couldn‚Äôt stay away, huh? Too bad‚Äîthere‚Äôs no place for you here anymore,\" Fu Xiaoran mocked.\n\n        \"Xiao Shu, we have guests today. This really isn‚Äôt the time. If you have something to discuss with Mingcheng, can it wait?\" Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs mother added, playing the mediator.\n\n        The mother-daughter duo was at it again‚Äîone harsh, one \"reasonable.\"\n\n        Lin Shu had no patience for their act. She turned to Han Ming.\n\n        Han Ming stepped forward, holding up the property deed.\n\n        \"I am Ms. Lin Shu‚Äôs legal representative. This villa at 208 Xijiang Road is her private property. You are to vacate the premises immediately. Otherwise, I will have no choice but to involve the police. For your information, unlawful occupation of a residence is a criminal offense punishable by up to three years in prison or detention.\"\n\n        The villa *was* legally under Lin Shu‚Äôs name. The Fu family had no defense.\n\n        Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs face darkened.\n\n        His mother shook her head, sighing. \"Xiao Shu, don‚Äôt be childish. We‚Äôre family‚Äîcan‚Äôt we talk this out? Must you bring lawyers into it?\"        \"Were you two really that close before? You actually gave her an entire villa.\" Song Zhiyi turned to Fu Mingcheng with a sour tone.\n\n        Since Fu Mingcheng had recently gifted her parents a luxury apartment, she instinctively assumed that the property deed in Lin Shu's hands was also from him.\n\n        Lin Shu couldn't be bothered to explain and simply said to Han Ming, \"Call the police.\"\n\n        \"Wait!\" Song Zhiyi was the first to object. As a famous actress, if the situation escalated after calling the police, she would suffer the most damage.\n\n        \"Lin Shu, can we talk for a moment?\" Song Zhiyi looked at her.\n\n        Lin Shu glanced at Song Zhiyi indifferently.\n\n        This was her first time seeing Song Zhiyi in person. With a short bob, dressed in a white blouse and a fitted skirt, her looks were merely above average‚Äînothing outstanding in an industry filled with beauties. But her demeanor was refined, and the roles she played were always striking and charismatic.\n\n        Standing beside Fu Mingcheng, her hand tightly clasped in his, her slightly raised chin exuded arrogance. To be so brazen as a mistress‚Äîtruly unmatched.\n\n        \"I have nothing to say to a homewrecker,\" Lin Shu retorted bluntly.\n\n        \"Lin Shu, I‚Äôm speaking to you politely. Your attitude makes you seem utterly uncivilized.\"\n\n        Song Zhiyi frowned, visibly displeased. \"I know you‚Äôre resentful, but love can‚Äôt be forced. Continuing like this will only humiliate you further. Besides, Mingcheng has already given you 10% of his company‚Äôs shares as compensation. Fu Media is now worth over a billion‚Äîhe hasn‚Äôt mistreated you. Take the money and leave with some dignity intact. If you get greedy, we won‚Äôt hold back either.\"\n\n        \"Finished?\" Lin Shu found it laughable. \"Is your father‚Äôs parenting‚Äîafter serving time in prison‚Äîteaching you to be a shameless mistress?!\"\n\n        \"What did you say? Who do you think you are to insult my father? Apologize. Apologize to me right now!\" Song Zhiyi seemed deeply offended, grabbing Lin Shu‚Äôs arm and hissing sharply.\n\n        \"Let go.\" Lin Shu had always disliked physical contact from strangers and shook her off impatiently.\n\n        Lin Shu hadn‚Äôt even used force, but Song Zhiyi let out a startled cry, staggering and collapsing to the ground. Clutching her stomach, she moaned in pain, \"It hurts‚Ä¶ my stomach!\"\n\n        \"Zhiyi!\" Fu Mingcheng panicked, scooping her up from the floor.\n\n        \"Mingcheng, save our baby‚Ä¶\" Song Zhiyi‚Äôs face was pale.\n\n        \"Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll take you to the hospital right now.\" Fu Mingcheng carried her out swiftly, pausing only to glare at Lin Shu. \"Lin Shu, you knew she was pregnant and still pushed her. When did you become so vicious?\"\n\n        Nestled in his arms, Song Zhiyi shot Lin Shu a triumphant look.\n\n        Lin Shu couldn‚Äôt help but sneer. \"No wonder you‚Äôre a top actress‚Äîsuch a performance.\"\n\n        \"Lin Shu, that‚Äôs enough!\" Fu Mingcheng looked utterly disappointed. \"If anything happens to Zhiyi or the baby, I won‚Äôt let you off!\"\n\n        Watching Fu Mingcheng carry Song Zhiyi away without a backward glance, Lin Shu had no time to grieve‚Äîthe police and moving crew arrived shortly after.\n\n        The officers sternly 'escorted' the Fu family out of the villa, while the movers unceremoniously tossed their belongings outside.\n\n        Madame Fu was so furious she nearly fainted, and Fu Xiaoran hopped around cursing. But no one paid them any attention.\n\n        The Fu family‚Äôs servants stood at the doorway, bewildered and lost.\n\n        \"You have thirty minutes to pack your things and leave,\" Lin Shu said coolly, unwilling to make things harder for them.\n\n        \"What about this month‚Äôs wages‚Ä¶?\" one servant dared to ask.\n\n        \"Ask whoever employed you. Understand?\" Lin Shu raised an eyebrow.\n\n        The servants nodded and scattered like startled birds.\n\n        Soon, the Fu family was gone, the servants had left, and even the police and movers departed. The sprawling villa fell into sudden silence.\n\n        Like a grand performance reaching its finale, she was left alone once more.\n\n        \"Xiao Shu, are‚Ä¶ are you okay?\" Jiang Nansheng stepped inside, concern in her voice.\n\n        \"Why wouldn‚Äôt I be? They‚Äôre the ones who should be worried.\" Lin Shu tilted her head back, forcing the welling tears to retreat.\n\n        Crying over someone unworthy made those tears worthless.\n\n        \"Tell Attorney Han to draft a new divorce agreement. I want 51% of Fu Media‚Äôs shares.\"\n\n        If love couldn‚Äôt be relied on, then money would have to do.\n\n        ---\n\n        Meanwhile, at City Hospital.\n\n        The doctor conducted a full examination of Song Zhiyi‚Äîeverything was normal.\n\n        But with her tear-streaked face, the physician couldn‚Äôt outright call it an act. Prescribing some prenatal supplements, they advised her to stay for observation.\n\n        In the hospital room.\n\n        Song Zhiyi leaned against Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs chest, still sniffling pitifully.\n\n        \"Thank goodness the baby‚Äôs fine. Otherwise, I‚Äôd regret it for life. I thought your wife, coming from an elite family, would be understanding of our feelings. I never imagined she‚Äôd resent even my unborn child. If she hates me, fine. But the baby is innocent.\"\n\n        \"I didn‚Äôt expect her jealousy to go this far either,\" Fu Mingcheng sighed, frowning. \"I‚Äôll finalize the divorce soon. She won‚Äôt get another chance to hurt you.\"\n\n        \"Mmm, I trust you.\" Song Zhiyi shyly lifted her chin, pressing her lips to his.\n\n        \"Ms. Song, your IV drip is finished. Let me remove the needle‚Äîoh, sorry.\" A nurse walked in just as they kissed.\n\n        \"It‚Äôs fine.\" Blushing, Song Zhiyi extended her arm with the IV.\n\n        The nurse removed the needle and discreetly left.\n\n        Back at the station, the young nurse buzzed with excitement, gossiping with colleagues.\n\n        \"Patient in Bed 16 is actually the celebrity Song Zhiyi! This is my first time seeing a star in person. She‚Äôs so pretty!\"\n\n        \"Song Zhiyi‚Äôs just average. You should‚Äôve seen Lin Shu back in the day‚Äîone smile could topple cities, another could conquer nations. Too bad she retired,\" another nurse remarked.\n\n        \"The man with her is the CEO of Fu Media, right? Tall, handsome, loaded‚ÄîSong Zhiyi‚Äôs living the dream. So enviable‚Ä¶\"\n\n        The nurse‚Äôs eyes sparkled with admiration, but before she could finish, the head nurse strode in.\n\n        \"Finished with your duties? Chatting on the clock?\"\n\n        The lively station fell silent. Head Nurse Yin said nothing else, stepping out coldly to make a call.\n\n        \"President Chen, Fu Mingcheng brought a pregnant woman to the hospital for prenatal care. Seems the rumors online are true.\"\n\n        \"I see.\" President Chen‚Äôs voice was heavy. After hanging up, he pondered before dialing Lin Shu‚Äôs number.\n\n        \"Uncle Chen.\"\n\n        \"Xiao Shu, Nurse Yin told me Fu Mingcheng accompanied a woman for prenatal care today. And then there‚Äôs the online news about him proposing to that actress‚Äîwhat‚Äôs going on?\" President Chen asked.\n\n        \"Yes, he‚Äôs in love with someone else. We‚Äôre negotiating the divorce,\" Lin Shu answered truthfully.\n\n        \"*Sigh*. I thought Fu Mingcheng was a decent man. Turns out he‚Äôs fickle. What a waste of your three years together. Don‚Äôt take it too hard, Xiao Shu. Quick marriages and divorces are common these days. What‚Äôs that phrase you youngsters say? 'If it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs over‚Äîthe next one will be better.'\"        After listening, Lin Shu couldn't help but smile.\n\n        Uncle Chen was a man devoted to academia, not one skilled in comforting others. It was quite an effort for him to say these words.\n\n        \"There's no need to worry about me, I'm fine. It's just that these three years have caused you a lot of trouble.\"\n\n        Aunt Fu's illness had always been under President Chen's care, and it was also President Chen who pulled strings to help arrange treatment at a hospital abroad.\n\n        \"Don't speak to Uncle Chen so formally. If your grandfather hadn‚Äôt funded me back then, I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today. Both your grandfather and your mother are gone‚Äîit‚Äôs only right for me to look after you.\"\n\n        \"Thank you, Uncle Chen.\" Aside from gratitude, Lin Shu didn‚Äôt know what else to say.\n\n        There were so many people in the world who understood gratitude‚Äîit was a shame she had misjudged the one she shouldn‚Äôt have.\n\n        ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\n\n        Fu Mingcheng had stayed at the hospital accompanying Song Zhiyi all night and only returned home the next day.\n\n        Madam Fu and Fu Xiaoran had already moved into Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs downtown apartment. With only one night to settle in, the place was still a mess, unpacked and disorganized.\n\n        \"I know Lin Shu can‚Äôt bear to leave you. I had originally intended to keep a place for her in the Fu family out of consideration for the three years she cared for me. But I never expected her to be so scheming, resorting to these underhanded tactics. The Fu family has no room for her anymore. Mingcheng, you must finalize the divorce as soon as possible.\"\n\n        Madam Fu clutched her chest, looking utterly heartbroken.\n\n        \"Yes, I understand.\" Fu Mingcheng replied with a grim expression, trying to console her. \"Mother, don‚Äôt be angry. It‚Äôs not worth ruining your health over Lin Shu.\"\n\n        \"How can I not be angry? I‚Äôm furious!\" Madam Fu‚Äôs health had never been robust, and after the day‚Äôs agitation, she indeed felt unwell. Instinctively, she said, \"I‚Äôm not feeling well. Tomorrow, have Lin Shu accompany me‚Äîno, never mind. Tomorrow, let Xiaoran take me to the hospital.\"\n\n        The next day, Fu Xiaoran accompanied Madam Fu to the city hospital.\n\n        As usual, they took the elevator directly upstairs and sought out Head Nurse Yin.\n\n        \"Head Nurse Yin, my mother isn‚Äôt feeling well. Have President Chen examine her,\" Fu Xiaoran demanded imperiously, standing in front of the nurse‚Äôs station in her sky-high heels.\n\n        \"President Chen is with another patient. He‚Äôs unavailable,\" Head Nurse Yin replied, her attitude noticeably colder than before, almost dismissive.\n\n        \"What patient could be more important than my mother? Every time we came before, President Chen would see us immediately!\"\n\n        \"Before was before. Now is now.\" Head Nurse Yin gave her a cold glance. \"Before, it was out of consideration for Lin Shu. Now that she‚Äôs divorcing your brother, why should President Chen continue giving you special treatment?\"\n\n        After saying this, Head Nurse Yin impatiently gestured toward the elevator. \"Don‚Äôt waste my time here. If you want to see a doctor, go to the outpatient department and queue like everyone else.\"\n\n        \"You‚Äîjust wait and see!\" Fu Xiaoran spat out a meaningless threat, but in the end, she still had to take Madam Fu to the outpatient clinic.\n\n        The specialist appointments were fully booked, and the general queue would take over two hours.\n\n        Upon hearing this, Madam Fu was so furious she nearly fainted.\n\n        \"That little wretch Lin Shu‚Äîshe must have done this on purpose! Call your brother right now. He needs to see exactly what kind of woman he married!\"\n\n        When Fu Mingcheng received his sister‚Äôs call, he was in the middle of a company meeting.\n\n        Over the years, Lin Shu had taken full responsibility for his mother‚Äôs medical care‚Äîdoctors, prescriptions, everything. He had never been involved and never needed to worry.\n\n        Now, hearing his sister accuse Lin Shu of instructing doctors to refuse his mother treatment, he was equally furious.\n\n        Unable to focus on the meeting, he dialed Lin Shu‚Äôs number.\n\n        \"Where are you?\"\n\n        \"Nansheng‚Äôs apartment.\"\n\n        \"We need to talk.\" Fu Mingcheng suppressed his anger.\n\n        \"Fine.\" Lin Shu‚Äôs reply was indifferent.\n\n        Lin Shu didn‚Äôt have many friends, so Fu Mingcheng knew Jiang Nansheng‚Äôs address and drove straight there.\n\n        In the years since marrying Fu Mingcheng, Lin Shu had been constantly busy caring for Madam Fu. Rarely did she have such leisurely moments. Now, she sat by the floor-to-ceiling window brewing Gongfu tea, the fading sunlight casting a glow over her, making her seem radiant.\n\n        When Fu Mingcheng stormed in and saw Lin Shu leisurely sipping tea, his fury only grew.\n\n        \"Lin Shu, don‚Äôt go too far. Having President Chen refuse treatment for Mother‚Äîare you trying to kill her? She let you call her ‚ÄòMother‚Äô for three years. How can you be so cruel?\"\n\n        \"President Chen refused to treat your mother?\" Lin Shu was momentarily taken aback, but then it made sense. President Chen was a top-tier specialist in the country, with countless patients waiting for his attention. If not for her, why would he ever spare time for the Fu family?\n\n        \"Lin Shu, stop pretending. Wasn‚Äôt this your doing?\" Fu Mingcheng said coldly.\n\n        Lin Shu took a sip of tea. Perhaps her tea-brewing skills had declined‚Äîthe taste was unusually bitter.\n\n        \"If President Chen won‚Äôt treat her, aren‚Äôt there other doctors? The country isn‚Äôt short of renowned nephrologists. If necessary, you can go abroad. We‚Äôre getting divorced‚Äîdo you really think it‚Äôs appropriate to keep using my connections for favors?\"\n\n        Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs handsome face darkened. Though Lin Shu‚Äôs words weren‚Äôt wrong, he still found her utterly heartless.\n\n        \"All these years, Mother treated you like her own daughter. I can‚Äôt believe it was wasted on you.\" Fu Mingcheng turned to leave, but Lin Shu stopped him.\n\n        \"Since you‚Äôre here, you might as well sign the divorce papers.\" Lin Shu set down her cup and slid the newly drafted divorce agreement toward him.\n\n        Fu Mingcheng skimmed through it before tossing it back onto the table with a sneer.\n\n        \"First, you have President Chen refuse Mother‚Äôs treatment. Now, you demand over half the company‚Äôs shares. Do you really think these underhanded tricks will make me change my mind? Let me be clear‚ÄîI will never give up Zhiyi. These tactics only disgust me.\"\n\n        Lin Shu looked at him, feeling a rare moment of shared understanding. Right now, she too felt disgusted‚Äîdeeply disgusted.\n\n        \"Fu Mingcheng, narcissism is an illness. You should get that treated.\"\n\n        \"Hah.\" Fu Mingcheng scoffed. \"Lin Shu, asking for 51% of Fu Media‚Äôs shares is pure delusion.\"\n\n        \"Without me, Fu Media would have gone bankrupt long ago. Strictly from a business standpoint, 51% isn‚Äôt unreasonable.\"\n\n        \"51% would mean Fu Media becomes the Lin family‚Äôs. I‚Äôll never agree.\"\n\n        \"Suit yourself.\" Lin Shu shrugged indifferently. \"Then we‚Äôll settle it in court. I hear divorce lawsuits can drag on for a year or more. I can wait‚Äîbut can you? In a few months, Song Zhiyi‚Äôs belly will start showing. Wedding dresses won‚Äôt look so flattering then, will they?\"\n\n        Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs face turned livid, the divorce agreement crumpling in his grip. After a long, icy glare, he stormed out.\n\n        Only after he left did Jiang Nansheng come downstairs, spitting in the direction of his departure before turning to Lin Shu.\n\n        \"You really plan to drag this out for a year?\"\n\n        \"Like I have time for that.\" Lin Shu picked up the purple clay teapot with her jade-like fingers, pouring another cup as she spoke. \"Find some reliable journalists. Let‚Äôs expose Fu Mingcheng‚Äôs marital status. What right does a cheating husband have to play the devoted lover in public?\"",

The adopted daughter they raised like a princess?\nStill smiling sweetly, still playing innocent.\n\nBut this time, I wasn‚Äôt here to be fooled.\n\nThey said I changed.\nNo‚ÄîI just stopped pretending to be someone worth forgiving.\n\nAnd when the secrets began to crack‚Äî\nwhen the lies Daniella wove unraveled one by one‚Äî\nthey looked at me like they‚Äôd never seen me before.\n\nToo late.\n\nI‚Äôm no longer the girl begging to be loved.\nI‚Äôm the woman they should‚Äôve feared all along.\n\nChapter 1 Going Home\nIn the prison on the outskirts of Cobridge, the prison guard said, \"Inmate 847, Abigail Gibson. Your family's here to pick you up. Be good from now on. Don't come back.\"\nAbigail mechanically took the storage box the guard handed her and gave a slight nod. She then followed the instructions to change out of her prison uniform and into the clothes she had worn when she arrived.\nThe short-sleeved dress had been sitting in storage for three years. The fabric was faded and worn, with several deep creases in the middle, and it hung loosely on her body.\nAbigail thought, 'Family?' She let out a cold, mocking laugh.\nThree years ago, the Gibson family had shown up at the orphanage with a paternity test, tearfully claiming that she was their long-lost heiress and brought her back to Cobridge.\nIt wasn't until she got there that Abigail found out her biological parents had adopted another daughter named Daniella Gibson to ease the pain of losing her.\nThe Gibson family had raised Daniella like a princess for fifteen years and couldn't bear to let her go.\nTo outsiders, they vaguely claimed Abigail had been sent to a village because of health reasons, while saying Daniella was her younger sister and still the youngest heiress of the Gibson family.\nBut then Daniella hit and killed someone with her car.\nThe Gibson family scolded Abigail, \"If you hadn't insisted we go to your graduation ceremony, we wouldn't have missed Dani's performance. She was distracted while driving because of that. This is your fault. You owe her.\"\nBefore Abigail could even protest, the Gibson family had already taken care of all the paperwork and thrown her in prison.\nAbigail thought, 'What family do I even have left?'\nThe prison gates slowly opened. Sunlight spilled in from outside, and Abigail squinted against the glare, spotting a man leaning against a car not far away.\nHe wore a beige long trench coat, a stark contrast to Abigail's thin dress, like they belonged to two different worlds.\nThat was Stephen Gibson, her biological second brother. The day she was brought back to the Gibson family, he was the one who'd picked her up, held her in his arms, and told her she'd now be the most cherished treasure of the Gibson household.\nBut later, it was Stephen who pinned down Abigail's hand and forced her to press her fingerprint on the confession letter just to protect Daniella.\nSeeing Abigail standing still, Stephen walked up to her and reached out to take her bag. \"Let's go home.\"\nAbigail gave a bitter smile. When she had first gone to prison, she used to imagine every day that the Gibson family would come to take her home.\nBut in prison, Abigail had been beaten until she vomited blood, starved until she had to crawl on the floor, and locked in the bathroom all night shivering from the cold.\nShe endured all of it and made it through three years, and not once did anyone from the Gibson family come to see her.\nNow Abigail had finally accepted the truth‚Äîthat between her and Daniella, the only one the Gibsons ever truly loved was Daniella.\nStephen saying \"Let's go home\" didn't seem to mean much to Abigail anymore.\nAbigail lowered her eyes and subtly avoided Stephen's hand. Her voice was distant. \"No thanks. I can carry it.\"\nStephen's hand hung in midair, frozen for a few seconds. The Abigail he remembered was easy to please. As long as he was a little nice to her, she would forget everything unpleasant, call him \"Stevie\" and cling to him sweetly.\nStephen had pictured her crying and thanking him for picking her up. But faced with her indifference, it hit him like a punch to the gut‚Äîsharp and suffocating.\nAfter all, Abigail was his real sister. Stephen held back his frustration and explained, \"Dani's been depressed since the car accident. Her mood's been all over the place.\n\"We've had to take turns staying with her so she wouldn't hurt herself. That's why we didn't come visit you.\"\nAs he spoke, something seemed to occur to him. He said, \"When you get back, don't stay in the main house. Go live in the nanny Georgia's room for a while, just in case Dani sees you and spirals again.\"\nWhen Abigail heard that, she only found it ironic. Daniella had killed someone, yet somehow ended up being the one everyone saw as the victim.\nThe whole family took turns looking after Daniella and they were so caught up in it that they forgot about Abigail, their actual flesh and blood sitting in prison. Even now that Abigail was coming home, they were still afraid she might upset Daniella.\nAbigail thought, 'I don't want this so-called home anymore. They can put me wherever they want‚Äîit doesn't matter.'\nA breeze passed through. Abigail rubbed her arms to fight the chill and responded in a low voice, \"Whatever you see fit.\"\nAside from that one glance at the beginning, she didn't look at Stephen again.\nStephen, however, suddenly remembered when Abigail was twelve. He had gone to pick her up, and she clung to his neck, timidly asking, \"Stevie, when I get home, will I have my own room?\"\nHe still remembered what he'd told her back then. He'd responded, \"You're the apple of our eye. You'll always stay in the biggest, nicest room.\"\nThat room was later given to Daniella. Abigail had cried and threw a fit over it for a long time. But now, it seemed like Abigail didn't care about anything anymore.\nStephen's chest tightened like it was stuffed with something heavy and suffocating. He frowned. \"If you're not happy about it, just tell me. I've got other properties. I can set you up somewhere else.\"\nAbigail shook her head. \"No need to trouble yourself, sir.\" That \"sir\" came from years of keeping her head down and knowing her place in prison.\nHowever, Stephen felt a rush of anger building inside. It sat heavy in his chest, hot and unsettled. \"You were only in prison for three years, doing just fine. But Dani nearly died multiple times.\n\"You can only blame yourself for dragging us to that stupid graduation ceremony. Dani only got into that accident because of you. She's not complaining, so what are you acting all high and mighty for?\n\"Did you forget what kind of life you had in the orphanage? Did we ever let you go without food or clothes under our roof? Don't be so ungrateful.\n\"If it weren't for the fact that you have to personally call off the engagement with the Fletcher family's heir, you think I'd waste my time picking you up?\"\nAfter he said that, Stephen turned without hesitation and slammed the car door shut. He didn't even look at Abigail as he started the engine and drove off without the slightest intention of waiting for her.\nAbigail hadn't expected anyone to pick her up anyway, so she wasn't particularly hurt by it.\nShe just found it ironic. Abigail had thought Stephen came to pick her up out of some sense of blood ties or decency, but it turned out he was only here to make sure she broke off the engagement with the Fletcher family's heir.\nThat engagement had been arranged by Abigail's grandfather, Wyatt, when she was a child. It was originally intended for Daniella. But after Abigail returned, Wyatt insisted on replacing Daniella with Abigail as the one engaged to the Fletcher boy.\nBecause of this, everyone hated Abigail for stealing Daniella's Fianc√©. Even the Fletcher heir himself, Ralph Fletcher, believed Abigail deliberately came between him and Daniella, and despised her for it.\nNow, Abigail was someone who'd served three years in prison, while Ralph had taken over the Fletcher family and was now firmly in charge. He was completely out of her league.\nAbigail thought, 'This engagement should be called off. I have no reason to feel anything about it.'\nShe tightened her grip on the bag in her hand. There was a phone inside, but it had long since run out of battery, along with some spare change she was reluctant to spend on transportation.\nStephen told Abigail to figure it out herself, so she had no choice but to walk.\nIt wasn't until Abigail reached the foot of the hill that she realized Cobridge was no longer the place she remembered. She didn't know which direction the Gibson Villa was in.\nShe tried to find someone to ask, but the moment people saw the way she was dressed, they immediately recognized her as someone freshly released from the prison up the hill. Everyone avoided her like the plague.\nAbigail felt lost and unsure what to do, so she randomly picked a direction and started walking.\nJust then, a black sedan slowly pulled up beside her. A man's cool, composed voice came from inside. \"Ms. Gibson.\"\nChapter 2 The Stolen Fianc√©\nThe black car blocked the road ahead. The window rolled down, revealing half of the man's face. To Abigail, that face was all too familiar.\nRalph's voice was indifferent. \"You won't get to Gibson Villa going this way. Are you planning to walk all the way there?\"\nAbigail looked at him, unsure how to respond. What she wanted was just to get far enough from the prison to find a ride home.\nRalph said, \"Cobridge has changed a lot in the past three years. You won't make it on foot. I'm heading to Gibson Villa.\"\nAbigail didn't understand. She thought, 'Is he offering me a ride?'\nShe stood there for a moment in a daze. Ralph looked more mature and composed now, no longer as unruly and arrogant as he had been three years ago. For a second, Abigail drifted into old memories and didn't know how to answer.\nRalph, however, had run out of patience. He got out of the car with a cold expression and stepped in front of her. \"Get in. I'll take you back. How much longer are you planning to stand here?\"\nHis words made Abigail fall silent. She didn't know why Ralph was here, and she didn't want to know. Thinking of her grandfather Wyatt, she turned and got into the car.\nInside, there was an unfamiliar, floral scent that made Abigail feel disoriented. She had sat in Ralph's car before. Back then, he'd always kept candy in the car, and it'd always had a sweet smell. The candy had been for her.\nBecause of that candy, Abigail had once believed she was special to Ralph. She had once been happy, thinking the feelings between them were mutual.\nBut the truth was, she had once heard him with her own ears, speaking about her to his friends with nothing but disdain.\nRalph had said, \"It's just some cheap candy. That's all it took to get her wrapped around my finger. I only gave it to her because I felt bad for her.\n\"That engagement? It was just some joke between our grandfathers. Besides, the Gibson family has more than one heiress.\"\nThe people around him had all agreed. In their eyes, Daniella, who had grown up with a wealthy upbringing, was a much better match for Ralph than Abigail. And Abigail, to them, was nothing more than someone Ralph humored because he happened to pity her.\nAbigail thought about how the gifts Ralph gave Daniella were nothing like the candy he used to give her. Now that Abigail looked back, it was clear how much‚Äîor how little‚ÄîRalph ever cared about her.\nAbigail never liked to force anything, not even an engagement that had originally belonged to her.\nShe had brought up ending it with Wyatt. Wyatt loved her and thought she'd been wronged, and wanted to go confront Ralph about it. She stopped him and asked for his agreement instead.\nWyatt agreed, but before the engagement could be called off, she ended up taking Daniella's place and going to prison.\nIt was only then that Abigail realized she was never that important to them. To be honest, aside from Wyatt, everyone else in the Gibson family‚Äîand Ralph‚Äînever truly welcomed her. She was like an intruder who had disturbed their perfect little family.\nThey never said it outright, but everything they did made it clear they wanted her gone. And yet it wasn't like she had done anything wrong.\nAbigail had grown up struggling to survive in an orphanage. Even after being adopted, she lived cautiously.\nShe once thought her birth parents must have really loved her to go through all that effort to find her. But reality hit her hard.\nThey already had an adopted daughter they adored, showered her with affection. Abigail wasn't like that‚Äîshe'd grown up scraping by with nothing.\nThey looked down on Abigail, treated her like she didn't belong. If it hadn't been for the blood tie, they wouldn't have wanted her at all.\nBack then, only Ralph had paid attention to Abigail's mood when she was feeling down. He'd offer her candy to cheer her up. To her, Ralph was like the light of her life. But that light only touched her for a brief moment.\nThree years in prison was enough to repay whatever debt she owed the Gibsons for bringing her into this world. As for that so-called family, she didn't want it anymore. She didn't want Ralph either.\nThe car pulled into Gibson Villa. As it came to a stop, a girl in a white dress walked over with a bright smile on her pretty face. \"Ralphie, what took you so long? Stevie and I have been waiting for you forever.\"\nStephen followed right behind, draping a coat over her shoulders.\nDaniella's smile froze the moment she saw Abigail. Her eyes turned slightly red, like she had been wronged.\n\"Abigail? Why are you in Ralph's car?\" Stephen questioned right away, his brows furrowed in what looked like obvious displeasure.\n\"I ran into her on my way here. Didn't you send someone to pick her up?\" Ralph asked. His words made Stephen fall silent.\nStephen thought, 'What am I supposed to say? That I did go but left her behind because I was pissed off by her attitude?'\n\"Stevie must've forgotten,\" Daniella said lightly. \"Abby, why didn't you call us? Good thing Ralphie ran into you.\"\nTo anyone listening, Daniella sounded kind and considerate. Abigail had thought the same when she first returned to the Gibson family.\nBut after being falsely accused by Daniella again and again, she finally saw it clearly. Some people were just good at pretending to be nice, always appearing soft and understanding.\nAnd the Gibson family fell for it every time. To them, Daniella was exactly the kind of daughter and sister they wanted.\n\"Abby, it's so good to have you back. I'm really happy, and so are Mom, Dad, and all our brothers,\" Daniella said with a radiant smile. Stephen looked at her with obvious affection in his eyes.\nAbigail didn't know and didn't care whether the Gibson family was happy. The only person she cared about was Wyatt. She knew Wyatt would be thrilled to see her. A hint of urgency started to build in Abigail's chest.\n\"Abigail, Dani's talking to you. Didn't you hear her?\" Stephen snapped, glaring at her like she was his enemy.\nDaniella bit her lip and tugged on Stephen's sleeve. \"Stevie, don't be like that. Abby never liked me. It's normal for her to ignore me. I'm used to it.\"\nStephen got even angrier and shouted at Abigail, \"Dani doesn't owe you anything.\"\nAbigail just found it ridiculous. \"She doesn't owe me anything, so you think I owe her instead?\"\nChapter 3 The Apple Of Their Eye\nIn the eyes of the Gibson family, Abigail owed Daniella just for coming back‚Äîbecause Daniella had gone from being the real heiress to the adopted one because of her.\nBut none of that was Abigail's choice. It wasn't her who found the Gibson family. They were the ones who found her. They brought her home, only to treat her like she didn't belong.\nAbigail felt confused and thought, 'If they think Daniella is so perfect that she could take the place of their real flesh and blood, then why bother looking for me and bringing me back?\n'Was it just so I could watch them spoil Daniella to her heart's content?'\nThe sarcasm in Abigail's eyes was obvious, and it made Stephen furious. His face darkened. \"If you hadn't been so reckless and selfish, Dani wouldn't have ended up in that mess.\"\n\"What mess?\" Abigail shot back.\nDaniella's expression changed instantly. \"Stevie, today's Abby's homecoming. Let's not bring up the past.\" She turned to Ralph. \"Ralphie, didn't you say you wanted to meet my grandpa? Let's go.\"\nRalph looked at Abigail, his eyes brooding and unreadable. \"You're not coming?\" he asked indifferently.\nAbigail's eyes lit up. She answered almost instinctively, \"I am.\"\nRalph gave a slight nod. \"Then let's go.\"\nAbigail was about to follow when Stephen suddenly grabbed her arm. His grip was so strong it made her frown in pain.\n\"You're planning to show up like that in front of Grandpa? What, trying to tattle on us again?\" Stephen sneered.\nAbigail didn't think there was anything wrong with what she was wearing. At least it was clean and tidy. But when it came to seeing Wyatt, she didn't want to argue with Stephen.\n\"I don't have a change of clothes,\" Abigail said.\nIn prison, she'd worn uniforms. She hadn't been allowed to wear her own clothes. The dress she had on now was the same one she'd worn three years ago. After being stored that long, it was faded and worn‚Äîunderstandably.\n\"Come with me,\" Stephen said, his gaze suddenly hard to read. Then he turned and walked away. Abigail followed behind him.\nAfter three years, the villa had changed a lot, and everything felt unfamiliar to Abigail.\nWhen they reached the second floor, Stephen's expression shifted slightly. \"You've been gone for three years, and no one's been using your room. We turned it into Dani's walk-in closet.\"\nAbigail paused for a moment, then gave a nod without much emotion. \"Got it.\"\nHer indifference, to Stephen, felt like she was giving him attitude again. He wanted to snap, but in the end, he knew they were in the wrong for how they had treated Abigail, so he held back.\nWith a grim expression, Stephen opened the door. Inside was an entire room turned into a walk-in closet. Transparent wardrobes lined the walls, filled with rows of clothes like a department store display, a clear sign of how much the Gibson family spoiled Daniella.\nStephen pulled out an outfit from a corner and tossed it to Abigail. \"These are clothes Dani doesn't like. She doesn't like anyone touching her stuff. You don't need to return it after you wear it. If you don't want it, throw it away.\"\nAbigail changed and came out. The fitted sweater hung a little loose on her, but she adjusted it quickly and stepped out. \"I'm done.\"\nStephen glanced at her, his expression hard to read. \"Let's go.\"\nAbigail didn't care about his cold attitude. Her heart was filled with excitement and nervousness at the thought of seeing Wyatt.\nStephen walked fast. Before Abigail could even catch up, he had already disappeared.\nAbigail didn't mind. She knew exactly where Wyatt lived. But just as she was about to step out of the villa, the joy bubbling in her chest vanished in an instant.\n\"Abby, you're finally home.\" Her mother, Bianca Gibson, teared up the moment she saw Abigail and choked up.\nBianca reached out to pull her into an embrace, but Abigail stepped back to avoid her.\nBianca's face fell. Her expression turned sorrowful. \"Abby, are you blaming me?\"\nAbigail didn't understand why Bianca would ask that and thought, 'Am I not supposed to blame her? They sent me to prison, made me suffer all that pain. I'm not allowed to blame them?'\n\"Mrs. Gibson, I'm going to see Grandpa.\" Abigail's voice was slightly hoarse.\nBianca looked like she had been dealt a heavy blow. Her whole body swayed. \"Abby, what did you just call me? You really are blaming me.\"\nTears streamed down Bianca's face. Even crying like this, she still looked elegant and beautiful, only now with a touch of fragility.\nWhen Abigail had first returned to the Gibson family, she used to really like Bianca. She thought Bianca was graceful, dignified, and kind.\nAbigail had hoped so many times that Bianca would speak to her the way she did to Daniella, with gentleness and affection.\nBut the only time Bianca had ever treated Abigail with that same softness was when she make Abigail go to prison in Daniella's place.\nAbigail thought, 'What a joke.'\n\"Mom, why are you crying?\" Daniella rushed over, full of concern as she came to Bianca's side.\nDaniella's voice quivered with emotion, and her eyes turned teary just like Bianca's. \"Abby, if you're mad, take it out on me. Just don't make Mom this sad.\n\"She's been skipping meals and losing sleep over you. She's already worn herself out. You may not care, but I do.\"\nBianca couldn't bear to see the adopted daughter she had lovingly raised in tears. She wiped her own tears away at once. \"Dani, I'm fine. Don't cry, sweetie. I'm okay.\"\n\"Mom, Abby has every right to resent me. If it weren't for me, she would've gotten all your love,\" Daniella said, biting her lip, her eyes brimming with tears, looking heartbreakingly pitiful.\n\"This isn't your fault, Dani. Don't overthink it,\" Bianca said patiently, comforting her. The two of them looked especially warm and close.\nChapter 4 Prison Life\nAbigail didn't want to see Bianca and Daniella putting on their sweet mother-daughter act.\nJust as Abigail walked past them, she saw Stephen coming from the other direction. He seemed to notice Bianca crying and quickened his pace, his tone sharp with anger. \"Abigail, what did you say to Mom?\"\nAbigail stared at him expressionlessly and asked calmly, \"Mr. Gibson, maybe you should ask your mother what she said to me. I only said one thing to her.\"\nStephen looked at Abigail with clear disbelief. He was about to say something when Bianca spoke up, \"Stevie, be nicer to Abby. I'm fine. I'm just really happy to see her again.\"\nStephen was scolded by Bianca and gave Abigail an annoyed look, but didn't say anything more.\n\"Abby, I got you new clothes and shoes. Why are you wearing something that doesn't even fit?\" Bianca glanced at Abigail, frowning slightly.\nAbigail looked up, her tone still laced with impatience. \"No need. This is fine. I'm going to see Grandpa.\"\nShe was about to leave, but Stephen reached out to block her and said, \"Grandpa's already sleeping.\"\n\"No way. Ralph is still with him, isn't he?\" Abigail's voice grew anxious. She hadn't seen Wyatt in three years, and now she was desperate to see him.\n\"Ralph already left,\" Stephen replied, clearly annoyed. He thought, 'If it weren't for her, Ralph would've stayed for dinner.'\n\"Abby, don't worry. You can see Grandpa tomorrow,\" Bianca said gently, trying to soothe Abigail.\nAbigail lowered her eyes in frustration. If it weren't for them, she would've made it in time to see Wyatt. She stayed quiet and turned to go inside.\n\"Abby, your room's all ready. Now that you're back, I really want to make things right,\" Bianca remarked softly.\nAbigail didn't react. She never planned to stay here in the first place. She just hadn't seen Wyatt yet.\n\"Okay,\" Abigail replied with a nod.\nBianca was overjoyed. Her eyes swept over the backpack in Abigail's hand, and a flash of pain crossed her expression. \"Stevie, is Abby's room all set up? Let her get some rest first.\"\nStephen looked a little uneasy. He answered, \"The room's not ready yet. Just let her stay in the maid's room for now.\"\n\"Stevie, what did you just say?\" Bianca looked like she couldn't believe what she was hearing. Stephen didn't say another word.\nAbigail spoke up, \"Where's the maid's room?\"\nShe didn't want to argue with them anymore. After getting an answer, she picked up her backpack and walked into the room on the first floor.\nBianca looked like she still wanted to say something, but when she thought of what Stephen had done, she stayed quiet.\nAbigail shut the door. The maid's room was simply furnished, but it had everything she needed. The Gibson family was wealthy, and even the maid's room wasn't small.\nAbigail wasn't picky about where she lived. She'd stayed in solitary confinement in prison before. In fact, the conditions here weren't bad at all.\nShe unpacked a little, took out her phone to charge it, and replied to a few messages. Then she heard a knock at the door.\n\"Abby, Mom asked me to call you for dinner.\" Daniella stood at the door with a bright smile.\nBut Abigail clearly saw the hostility hidden in Daniella's eyes. She replied, \"Got it. Let's go.\"\nAt the dinner table, Bianca enthusiastically placed food onto Abigail's plate. Abigail instinctively shielded her own plate and pulled away. A piece of broccoli fell onto the table.\nStephen's voice was low and laced with anger. \"Abigail, what are you dodging for? Mom's just trying to serve you.\"\n\"Sorry. It's a habit,\" Abigail said.\nShe really had gotten used to it. In prison, anytime someone reached over during meals, it was either to steal food from her plate or to throw trash onto it. If she didn't move fast enough, she wouldn't be able to eat at all.\nStephen let out a sharp laugh out of anger. \"Abigail, you're such a bad liar. You think we're actually going to believe that?\"\nAbigail put down her utensils and looked straight at him. \"Whether you believe it or not is up to you.\"\nBianca quickly stepped in. \"Stevie, Abby didn't mean anything by it. Come on, let's eat before the food gets cold.\"\nStephen held back his anger and stayed quiet, but the way he looked at Abigail felt like he was throwing knives at her.\nAbigail pretended not to notice. She'd seen worse‚Äîcrueler, darker stares than his. Compared to them, Stephen was nothing.\n\"Abby, why aren't you eating? Is the food not to your taste?\" Bianca looked at her, concerned.\nAbigail didn't know why Bianca was paying so much attention to her today. If this had been three years ago, she would've been thrilled, thinking Bianca had finally seen her, finally cared, finally wanted to be gentle with her.\nThree years ago, Abigail would've needed Bianca's attention. But now, she didn't.\n\"No, it's just a bit too heavy. I can't handle it,\" Abigail said.\nThe food on the table wasn't greasy, but everything had that sweet-and-spicy flavor Daniella liked.\nStephen couldn't help himself and sneered, \"Didn't you eat just fine before? Now suddenly you can't?\"\nAbigail looked up at him, her voice flat. \"Back then I hadn't starved myself sick. After three years in prison, being hungry became normal. Eating fast became normal. And getting stomach problems became normal, too.\"\nStephen froze. Bianca's eyes turned red as she asked, \"Abby, why didn't you call us and say something? I always thought you were doing fine in there.\"\nAbigail only found it ironic. 'How could prison life ever be fine?' she thought. They were the ones who sent her in, and after that, they didn't lift a finger to help.\nPrison was the kind of place where the strong thrived and the weak got crushed. Abigail had no money, no power. Getting pushed around was her everyday reality.\nAs for the phone calls, Abigail could only let out a cold laugh at the thought. \"I did call,\" she said.\n\"That's impossible,\" Stephen blurted out. \"No one at home ever got a call from you.\" As he spoke, he suddenly stopped.\nA trace of mockery appeared in Abigail's eyes. \"Two months after I went in, I called home. A maid answered. She told me you all said I should focus on serving my sentence and not call again.\"\nThe atmosphere at the table froze instantly.\n0:00 / 9:02",

I just want to rest.‚Äù\nShe knew then‚Äî\nno matter what she did,\nthey would always choose the other girl.\nThe truth came too late.\nThe adopted daughter had staged the accident,\nripped up her university acceptance,\nand silenced her only call from prison.\nNow, they want to make it right.\nBut she‚Äôs already gone.\nAnd they‚Äôre left to mourn the daughter they betrayed.\n\nChapter 1 Going Home\nIn the prison on the outskirts of Cobridge, the prison guard said, \"Inmate 847, Abigail Gibson. Your family's here to pick you up. Be good from now on. Don't come back.\"\nAbigail mechanically took the storage box the guard handed her and gave a slight nod. She then followed the instructions to change out of her prison uniform and into the clothes she had worn when she arrived.\nThe short-sleeved dress had been sitting in storage for three years. The fabric was faded and worn, with several deep creases in the middle, and it hung loosely on her body.\nAbigail thought, 'Family?' She let out a cold, mocking laugh.\nThree years ago, the Gibson family had shown up at the orphanage with a paternity test, tearfully claiming that she was their long-lost heiress and brought her back to Cobridge.\nIt wasn't until she got there that Abigail found out her biological parents had adopted another daughter named Daniella Gibson to ease the pain of losing her.\nThe Gibson family had raised Daniella like a princess for fifteen years and couldn't bear to let her go.\nTo outsiders, they vaguely claimed Abigail had been sent to a village because of health reasons, while saying Daniella was her younger sister and still the youngest heiress of the Gibson family.\nBut then Daniella hit and killed someone with her car.\nThe Gibson family scolded Abigail, \"If you hadn't insisted we go to your graduation ceremony, we wouldn't have missed Dani's performance. She was distracted while driving because of that. This is your fault. You owe her.\"\nBefore Abigail could even protest, the Gibson family had already taken care of all the paperwork and thrown her in prison.\nAbigail thought, 'What family do I even have left?'\nThe prison gates slowly opened. Sunlight spilled in from outside, and Abigail squinted against the glare, spotting a man leaning against a car not far away.\nHe wore a beige long trench coat, a stark contrast to Abigail's thin dress, like they belonged to two different worlds.\nThat was Stephen Gibson, her biological second brother. The day she was brought back to the Gibson family, he was the one who'd picked her up, held her in his arms, and told her she'd now be the most cherished treasure of the Gibson household.\nBut later, it was Stephen who pinned down Abigail's hand and forced her to press her fingerprint on the confession letter just to protect Daniella.\nSeeing Abigail standing still, Stephen walked up to her and reached out to take her bag. \"Let's go home.\"\nAbigail gave a bitter smile. When she had first gone to prison, she used to imagine every day that the Gibson family would come to take her home.\nBut in prison, Abigail had been beaten until she vomited blood, starved until she had to crawl on the floor, and locked in the bathroom all night shivering from the cold.\nShe endured all of it and made it through three years, and not once did anyone from the Gibson family come to see her.\nNow Abigail had finally accepted the truth‚Äîthat between her and Daniella, the only one the Gibsons ever truly loved was Daniella.\nStephen saying \"Let's go home\" didn't seem to mean much to Abigail anymore.\nAbigail lowered her eyes and subtly avoided Stephen's hand. Her voice was distant. \"No thanks. I can carry it.\"\nStephen's hand hung in midair, frozen for a few seconds. The Abigail he remembered was easy to please. As long as he was a little nice to her, she would forget everything unpleasant, call him \"Stevie\" and cling to him sweetly.\nStephen had pictured her crying and thanking him for picking her up. But faced with her indifference, it hit him like a punch to the gut‚Äîsharp and suffocating.\nAfter all, Abigail was his real sister. Stephen held back his frustration and explained, \"Dani's been depressed since the car accident. Her mood's been all over the place.\n\"We've had to take turns staying with her so she wouldn't hurt herself. That's why we didn't come visit you.\"\nAs he spoke, something seemed to occur to him. He said, \"When you get back, don't stay in the main house. Go live in the nanny Georgia's room for a while, just in case Dani sees you and spirals again.\"\nWhen Abigail heard that, she only found it ironic. Daniella had killed someone, yet somehow ended up being the one everyone saw as the victim.\nThe whole family took turns looking after Daniella and they were so caught up in it that they forgot about Abigail, their actual flesh and blood sitting in prison. Even now that Abigail was coming home, they were still afraid she might upset Daniella.\nAbigail thought, 'I don't want this so-called home anymore. They can put me wherever they want‚Äîit doesn't matter.'\nA breeze passed through. Abigail rubbed her arms to fight the chill and responded in a low voice, \"Whatever you see fit.\"\nAside from that one glance at the beginning, she didn't look at Stephen again.\nStephen, however, suddenly remembered when Abigail was twelve. He had gone to pick her up, and she clung to his neck, timidly asking, \"Stevie, when I get home, will I have my own room?\"\nHe still remembered what he'd told her back then. He'd responded, \"You're the apple of our eye. You'll always stay in the biggest, nicest room.\"\nThat room was later given to Daniella. Abigail had cried and threw a fit over it for a long time. But now, it seemed like Abigail didn't care about anything anymore.\nStephen's chest tightened like it was stuffed with something heavy and suffocating. He frowned. \"If you're not happy about it, just tell me. I've got other properties. I can set you up somewhere else.\"\nAbigail shook her head. \"No need to trouble yourself, sir.\" That \"sir\" came from years of keeping her head down and knowing her place in prison.\nHowever, Stephen felt a rush of anger building inside. It sat heavy in his chest, hot and unsettled. \"You were only in prison for three years, doing just fine. But Dani nearly died multiple times.\n\"You can only blame yourself for dragging us to that stupid graduation ceremony. Dani only got into that accident because of you. She's not complaining, so what are you acting all high and mighty for?\n\"Did you forget what kind of life you had in the orphanage? Did we ever let you go without food or clothes under our roof? Don't be so ungrateful.\n\"If it weren't for the fact that you have to personally call off the engagement with the Fletcher family's heir, you think I'd waste my time picking you up?\"\nAfter he said that, Stephen turned without hesitation and slammed the car door shut. He didn't even look at Abigail as he started the engine and drove off without the slightest intention of waiting for her.\nAbigail hadn't expected anyone to pick her up anyway, so she wasn't particularly hurt by it.\nShe just found it ironic. Abigail had thought Stephen came to pick her up out of some sense of blood ties or decency, but it turned out he was only here to make sure she broke off the engagement with the Fletcher family's heir.\nThat engagement had been arranged by Abigail's grandfather, Wyatt, when she was a child. It was originally intended for Daniella. But after Abigail returned, Wyatt insisted on replacing Daniella with Abigail as the one engaged to the Fletcher boy.\nBecause of this, everyone hated Abigail for stealing Daniella's Fianc√©. Even the Fletcher heir himself, Ralph Fletcher, believed Abigail deliberately came between him and Daniella, and despised her for it.\nNow, Abigail was someone who'd served three years in prison, while Ralph had taken over the Fletcher family and was now firmly in charge. He was completely out of her league.\nAbigail thought, 'This engagement should be called off. I have no reason to feel anything about it.'\nShe tightened her grip on the bag in her hand. There was a phone inside, but it had long since run out of battery, along with some spare change she was reluctant to spend on transportation.\nStephen told Abigail to figure it out herself, so she had no choice but to walk.\nIt wasn't until Abigail reached the foot of the hill that she realized Cobridge was no longer the place she remembered. She didn't know which direction the Gibson Villa was in.\nShe tried to find someone to ask, but the moment people saw the way she was dressed, they immediately recognized her as someone freshly released from the prison up the hill. Everyone avoided her like the plague.\nAbigail felt lost and unsure what to do, so she randomly picked a direction and started walking.\nJust then, a black sedan slowly pulled up beside her. A man's cool, composed voice came from inside. \"Ms. Gibson.\"\nChapter 2 The Stolen Fianc√©\nThe black car blocked the road ahead. The window rolled down, revealing half of the man's face. To Abigail, that face was all too familiar.\nRalph's voice was indifferent. \"You won't get to Gibson Villa going this way. Are you planning to walk all the way there?\"\nAbigail looked at him, unsure how to respond. What she wanted was just to get far enough from the prison to find a ride home.\nRalph said, \"Cobridge has changed a lot in the past three years. You won't make it on foot. I'm heading to Gibson Villa.\"\nAbigail didn't understand. She thought, 'Is he offering me a ride?'\nShe stood there for a moment in a daze. Ralph looked more mature and composed now, no longer as unruly and arrogant as he had been three years ago. For a second, Abigail drifted into old memories and didn't know how to answer.\nRalph, however, had run out of patience. He got out of the car with a cold expression and stepped in front of her. \"Get in. I'll take you back. How much longer are you planning to stand here?\"\nHis words made Abigail fall silent. She didn't know why Ralph was here, and she didn't want to know. Thinking of her grandfather Wyatt, she turned and got into the car.\nInside, there was an unfamiliar, floral scent that made Abigail feel disoriented. She had sat in Ralph's car before. Back then, he'd always kept candy in the car, and it'd always had a sweet smell. The candy had been for her.\nBecause of that candy, Abigail had once believed she was special to Ralph. She had once been happy, thinking the feelings between them were mutual.\nBut the truth was, she had once heard him with her own ears, speaking about her to his friends with nothing but disdain.\nRalph had said, \"It's just some cheap candy. That's all it took to get her wrapped around my finger. I only gave it to her because I felt bad for her.\n\"That engagement? It was just some joke between our grandfathers. Besides, the Gibson family has more than one heiress.\"\nThe people around him had all agreed. In their eyes, Daniella, who had grown up with a wealthy upbringing, was a much better match for Ralph than Abigail. And Abigail, to them, was nothing more than someone Ralph humored because he happened to pity her.\nAbigail thought about how the gifts Ralph gave Daniella were nothing like the candy he used to give her. Now that Abigail looked back, it was clear how much‚Äîor how little‚ÄîRalph ever cared about her.\nAbigail never liked to force anything, not even an engagement that had originally belonged to her.\nShe had brought up ending it with Wyatt. Wyatt loved her and thought she'd been wronged, and wanted to go confront Ralph about it. She stopped him and asked for his agreement instead.\nWyatt agreed, but before the engagement could be called off, she ended up taking Daniella's place and going to prison.\nIt was only then that Abigail realized she was never that important to them. To be honest, aside from Wyatt, everyone else in the Gibson family‚Äîand Ralph‚Äînever truly welcomed her. She was like an intruder who had disturbed their perfect little family.\nThey never said it outright, but everything they did made it clear they wanted her gone. And yet it wasn't like she had done anything wrong.\nAbigail had grown up struggling to survive in an orphanage. Even after being adopted, she lived cautiously.\nShe once thought her birth parents must have really loved her to go through all that effort to find her. But reality hit her hard.\nThey already had an adopted daughter they adored, showered her with affection. Abigail wasn't like that‚Äîshe'd grown up scraping by with nothing.\nThey looked down on Abigail, treated her like she didn't belong. If it hadn't been for the blood tie, they wouldn't have wanted her at all.\nBack then, only Ralph had paid attention to Abigail's mood when she was feeling down. He'd offer her candy to cheer her up. To her, Ralph was like the light of her life. But that light only touched her for a brief moment.\nThree years in prison was enough to repay whatever debt she owed the Gibsons for bringing her into this world. As for that so-called family, she didn't want it anymore. She didn't want Ralph either.\nThe car pulled into Gibson Villa. As it came to a stop, a girl in a white dress walked over with a bright smile on her pretty face. \"Ralphie, what took you so long? Stevie and I have been waiting for you forever.\"\nStephen followed right behind, draping a coat over her shoulders.\nDaniella's smile froze the moment she saw Abigail. Her eyes turned slightly red, like she had been wronged.\n\"Abigail? Why are you in Ralph's car?\" Stephen questioned right away, his brows furrowed in what looked like obvious displeasure.\n\"I ran into her on my way here. Didn't you send someone to pick her up?\" Ralph asked. His words made Stephen fall silent.\nStephen thought, 'What am I supposed to say? That I did go but left her behind because I was pissed off by her attitude?'\n\"Stevie must've forgotten,\" Daniella said lightly. \"Abby, why didn't you call us? Good thing Ralphie ran into you.\"\nTo anyone listening, Daniella sounded kind and considerate. Abigail had thought the same when she first returned to the Gibson family.\nBut after being falsely accused by Daniella again and again, she finally saw it clearly. Some people were just good at pretending to be nice, always appearing soft and understanding.\nAnd the Gibson family fell for it every time. To them, Daniella was exactly the kind of daughter and sister they wanted.\n\"Abby, it's so good to have you back. I'm really happy, and so are Mom, Dad, and all our brothers,\" Daniella said with a radiant smile. Stephen looked at her with obvious affection in his eyes.\nAbigail didn't know and didn't care whether the Gibson family was happy. The only person she cared about was Wyatt. She knew Wyatt would be thrilled to see her. A hint of urgency started to build in Abigail's chest.\n\"Abigail, Dani's talking to you. Didn't you hear her?\" Stephen snapped, glaring at her like she was his enemy.\nDaniella bit her lip and tugged on Stephen's sleeve. \"Stevie, don't be like that. Abby never liked me. It's normal for her to ignore me. I'm used to it.\"\nStephen got even angrier and shouted at Abigail, \"Dani doesn't owe you anything.\"\nAbigail just found it ridiculous. \"She doesn't owe me anything, so you think I owe her instead?\"\nChapter 3 The Apple Of Their Eye\nIn the eyes of the Gibson family, Abigail owed Daniella just for coming back‚Äîbecause Daniella had gone from being the real heiress to the adopted one because of her.\nBut none of that was Abigail's choice. It wasn't her who found the Gibson family. They were the ones who found her. They brought her home, only to treat her like she didn't belong.\nAbigail felt confused and thought, 'If they think Daniella is so perfect that she could take the place of their real flesh and blood, then why bother looking for me and bringing me back?\n'Was it just so I could watch them spoil Daniella to her heart's content?'\nThe sarcasm in Abigail's eyes was obvious, and it made Stephen furious. His face darkened. \"If you hadn't been so reckless and selfish, Dani wouldn't have ended up in that mess.\"\n\"What mess?\" Abigail shot back.\nDaniella's expression changed instantly. \"Stevie, today's Abby's homecoming. Let's not bring up the past.\" She turned to Ralph. \"Ralphie, didn't you say you wanted to meet my grandpa? Let's go.\"\nRalph looked at Abigail, his eyes brooding and unreadable. \"You're not coming?\" he asked indifferently.\nAbigail's eyes lit up. She answered almost instinctively, \"I am.\"\nRalph gave a slight nod. \"Then let's go.\"\nAbigail was about to follow when Stephen suddenly grabbed her arm. His grip was so strong it made her frown in pain.\n\"You're planning to show up like that in front of Grandpa? What, trying to tattle on us again?\" Stephen sneered.\nAbigail didn't think there was anything wrong with what she was wearing. At least it was clean and tidy. But when it came to seeing Wyatt, she didn't want to argue with Stephen.\n\"I don't have a change of clothes,\" Abigail said.\nIn prison, she'd worn uniforms. She hadn't been allowed to wear her own clothes. The dress she had on now was the same one she'd worn three years ago. After being stored that long, it was faded and worn‚Äîunderstandably.\n\"Come with me,\" Stephen said, his gaze suddenly hard to read. Then he turned and walked away. Abigail followed behind him.\nAfter three years, the villa had changed a lot, and everything felt unfamiliar to Abigail.\nWhen they reached the second floor, Stephen's expression shifted slightly. \"You've been gone for three years, and no one's been using your room. We turned it into Dani's walk-in closet.\"\nAbigail paused for a moment, then gave a nod without much emotion. \"Got it.\"\nHer indifference, to Stephen, felt like she was giving him attitude again. He wanted to snap, but in the end, he knew they were in the wrong for how they had treated Abigail, so he held back.\nWith a grim expression, Stephen opened the door. Inside was an entire room turned into a walk-in closet. Transparent wardrobes lined the walls, filled with rows of clothes like a department store display, a clear sign of how much the Gibson family spoiled Daniella.\nStephen pulled out an outfit from a corner and tossed it to Abigail. \"These are clothes Dani doesn't like. She doesn't like anyone touching her stuff. You don't need to return it after you wear it. If you don't want it, throw it away.\"\nAbigail changed and came out. The fitted sweater hung a little loose on her, but she adjusted it quickly and stepped out. \"I'm done.\"\nStephen glanced at her, his expression hard to read. \"Let's go.\"\nAbigail didn't care about his cold attitude. Her heart was filled with excitement and nervousness at the thought of seeing Wyatt.\nStephen walked fast. Before Abigail could even catch up, he had already disappeared.\nAbigail didn't mind. She knew exactly where Wyatt lived. But just as she was about to step out of the villa, the joy bubbling in her chest vanished in an instant.\n\"Abby, you're finally home.\" Her mother, Bianca Gibson, teared up the moment she saw Abigail and choked up.\nBianca reached out to pull her into an embrace, but Abigail stepped back to avoid her.\nBianca's face fell. Her expression turned sorrowful. \"Abby, are you blaming me?\"\nAbigail didn't understand why Bianca would ask that and thought, 'Am I not supposed to blame her? They sent me to prison, made me suffer all that pain. I'm not allowed to blame them?'\n\"Mrs. Gibson, I'm going to see Grandpa.\" Abigail's voice was slightly hoarse.\nBianca looked like she had been dealt a heavy blow. Her whole body swayed. \"Abby, what did you just call me? You really are blaming me.\"\nTears streamed down Bianca's face. Even crying like this, she still looked elegant and beautiful, only now with a touch of fragility.\nWhen Abigail had first returned to the Gibson family, she used to really like Bianca. She thought Bianca was graceful, dignified, and kind.\nAbigail had hoped so many times that Bianca would speak to her the way she did to Daniella, with gentleness and affection.\nBut the only time Bianca had ever treated Abigail with that same softness was when she make Abigail go to prison in Daniella's place.\nAbigail thought, 'What a joke.'\n\"Mom, why are you crying?\" Daniella rushed over, full of concern as she came to Bianca's side.\nDaniella's voice quivered with emotion, and her eyes turned teary just like Bianca's. \"Abby, if you're mad, take it out on me. Just don't make Mom this sad.\n\"She's been skipping meals and losing sleep over you. She's already worn herself out. You may not care, but I do.\"\nBianca couldn't bear to see the adopted daughter she had lovingly raised in tears. She wiped her own tears away at once. \"Dani, I'm fine. Don't cry, sweetie. I'm okay.\"\n\"Mom, Abby has every right to resent me. If it weren't for me, she would've gotten all your love,\" Daniella said, biting her lip, her eyes brimming with tears, looking heartbreakingly pitiful.\n\"This isn't your fault, Dani. Don't overthink it,\" Bianca said patiently, comforting her. The two of them looked especially warm and close.\nChapter 4 Prison Life\nAbigail didn't want to see Bianca and Daniella putting on their sweet mother-daughter act.\nJust as Abigail walked past them, she saw Stephen coming from the other direction. He seemed to notice Bianca crying and quickened his pace, his tone sharp with anger. \"Abigail, what did you say to Mom?\"\nAbigail stared at him expressionlessly and asked calmly, \"Mr. Gibson, maybe you should ask your mother what she said to me. I only said one thing to her.\"\nStephen looked at Abigail with clear disbelief. He was about to say something when Bianca spoke up, \"Stevie, be nicer to Abby. I'm fine. I'm just really happy to see her again.\"\nStephen was scolded by Bianca and gave Abigail an annoyed look, but didn't say anything more.\n\"Abby, I got you new clothes and shoes. Why are you wearing something that doesn't even fit?\" Bianca glanced at Abigail, frowning slightly.\nAbigail looked up, her tone still laced with impatience. \"No need. This is fine. I'm going to see Grandpa.\"\nShe was about to leave, but Stephen reached out to block her and said, \"Grandpa's already sleeping.\"\n\"No way. Ralph is still with him, isn't he?\" Abigail's voice grew anxious. She hadn't seen Wyatt in three years, and now she was desperate to see him.\n\"Ralph already left,\" Stephen replied, clearly annoyed. He thought, 'If it weren't for her, Ralph would've stayed for dinner.'\n\"Abby, don't worry. You can see Grandpa tomorrow,\" Bianca said gently, trying to soothe Abigail.\nAbigail lowered her eyes in frustration. If it weren't for them, she would've made it in time to see Wyatt. She stayed quiet and turned to go inside.\n\"Abby, your room's all ready. Now that you're back, I really want to make things right,\" Bianca remarked softly.\nAbigail didn't react. She never planned to stay here in the first place. She just hadn't seen Wyatt yet.\n\"Okay,\" Abigail replied with a nod.\nBianca was overjoyed. Her eyes swept over the backpack in Abigail's hand, and a flash of pain crossed her expression. \"Stevie, is Abby's room all set up? Let her get some rest first.\"\nStephen looked a little uneasy. He answered, \"The room's not ready yet. Just let her stay in the maid's room for now.\"\n\"Stevie, what did you just say?\" Bianca looked like she couldn't believe what she was hearing. Stephen didn't say another word.\nAbigail spoke up, \"Where's the maid's room?\"\nShe didn't want to argue with them anymore. After getting an answer, she picked up her backpack and walked into the room on the first floor.\nBianca looked like she still wanted to say something, but when she thought of what Stephen had done, she stayed quiet.\nAbigail shut the door. The maid's room was simply furnished, but it had everything she needed. The Gibson family was wealthy, and even the maid's room wasn't small.\nAbigail wasn't picky about where she lived. She'd stayed in solitary confinement in prison before. In fact, the conditions here weren't bad at all.\nShe unpacked a little, took out her phone to charge it, and replied to a few messages. Then she heard a knock at the door.\n\"Abby, Mom asked me to call you for dinner.\" Daniella stood at the door with a bright smile.\nBut Abigail clearly saw the hostility hidden in Daniella's eyes. She replied, \"Got it. Let's go.\"\nAt the dinner table, Bianca enthusiastically placed food onto Abigail's plate. Abigail instinctively shielded her own plate and pulled away. A piece of broccoli fell onto the table.\nStephen's voice was low and laced with anger. \"Abigail, what are you dodging for? Mom's just trying to serve you.\"\n\"Sorry. It's a habit,\" Abigail said.\nShe really had gotten used to it. In prison, anytime someone reached over during meals, it was either to steal food from her plate or to throw trash onto it. If she didn't move fast enough, she wouldn't be able to eat at all.\nStephen let out a sharp laugh out of anger. \"Abigail, you're such a bad liar. You think we're actually going to believe that?\"\nAbigail put down her utensils and looked straight at him. \"Whether you believe it or not is up to you.\"\nBianca quickly stepped in. \"Stevie, Abby didn't mean anything by it. Come on, let's eat before the food gets cold.\"\nStephen held back his anger and stayed quiet, but the way he looked at Abigail felt like he was throwing knives at her.\nAbigail pretended not to notice. She'd seen worse‚Äîcrueler, darker stares than his. Compared to them, Stephen was nothing.\n\"Abby, why aren't you eating? Is the food not to your taste?\" Bianca looked at her, concerned.\nAbigail didn't know why Bianca was paying so much attention to her today. If this had been three years ago, she would've been thrilled, thinking Bianca had finally seen her, finally cared, finally wanted to be gentle with her.\nThree years ago, Abigail would've needed Bianca's attention. But now, she didn't.\n\"No, it's just a bit too heavy. I can't handle it,\" Abigail said.\nThe food on the table wasn't greasy, but everything had that sweet-and-spicy flavor Daniella liked.\nStephen couldn't help himself and sneered, \"Didn't you eat just fine before? Now suddenly you can't?\"\nAbigail looked up at him, her voice flat. \"Back then I hadn't starved myself sick. After three years in prison, being hungry became normal. Eating fast became normal. And getting stomach problems became normal, too.\"\nStephen froze. Bianca's eyes turned red as she asked, \"Abby, why didn't you call us and say something? I always thought you were doing fine in there.\"\nAbigail only found it ironic. 'How could prison life ever be fine?' she thought. They were the ones who sent her in, and after that, they didn't lift a finger to help.\nPrison was the kind of place where the strong thrived and the weak got crushed. Abigail had no money, no power. Getting pushed around was her everyday reality.\nAs for the phone calls, Abigail could only let out a cold laugh at the thought. \"I did call,\" she said.\n\"That's impossible,\" Stephen blurted out. \"No one at home ever got a call from you.\" As he spoke, he suddenly stopped.\nA trace of mockery appeared in Abigail's eyes. \"Two months after I went in, I called home. A maid answered. She told me you all said I should focus on serving my sentence and not call again.\"\nThe atmosphere at the table froze instantly.\n0:00 / 0:16",

Your family's here to pick you up. Be good from now on. Don't come back.\"\nAbigail mechanically took the storage box the guard handed her and gave a slight nod. She then followed the instructions to change out of her prison uniform and into the clothes she had worn when she arrived.\nThe short-sleeved dress had been sitting in storage for three years. The fabric was faded and worn, with several deep creases in the middle, and it hung loosely on her body.\nAbigail thought, 'Family?' She let out a cold, mocking laugh.\nThree years ago, the Gibson family had shown up at the orphanage with a paternity test, tearfully claiming that she was their long-lost heiress and brought her back to Cobridge.\nIt wasn't until she got there that Abigail found out her biological parents had adopted another daughter named Daniella Gibson to ease the pain of losing her.\nThe Gibson family had raised Daniella like a princess for fifteen years and couldn't bear to let her go.\nTo outsiders, they vaguely claimed Abigail had been sent to a village because of health reasons, while saying Daniella was her younger sister and still the youngest heiress of the Gibson family.\nBut then Daniella hit and killed someone with her car.\nThe Gibson family scolded Abigail, \"If you hadn't insisted we go to your graduation ceremony, we wouldn't have missed Dani's performance. She was distracted while driving because of that. This is your fault. You owe her.\"\nBefore Abigail could even protest, the Gibson family had already taken care of all the paperwork and thrown her in prison.\nAbigail thought, 'What family do I even have left?'\nThe prison gates slowly opened. Sunlight spilled in from outside, and Abigail squinted against the glare, spotting a man leaning against a car not far away.\nHe wore a beige long trench coat, a stark contrast to Abigail's thin dress, like they belonged to two different worlds.\nThat was Stephen Gibson, her biological second brother. The day she was brought back to the Gibson family, he was the one who'd picked her up, held her in his arms, and told her she'd now be the most cherished treasure of the Gibson household.\nBut later, it was Stephen who pinned down Abigail's hand and forced her to press her fingerprint on the confession letter just to protect Daniella.\nSeeing Abigail standing still, Stephen walked up to her and reached out to take her bag. \"Let's go home.\"\nAbigail gave a bitter smile. When she had first gone to prison, she used to imagine every day that the Gibson family would come to take her home.\nBut in prison, Abigail had been beaten until she vomited blood, starved until she had to crawl on the floor, and locked in the bathroom all night shivering from the cold.\nShe endured all of it and made it through three years, and not once did anyone from the Gibson family come to see her.\nNow Abigail had finally accepted the truth‚Äîthat between her and Daniella, the only one the Gibsons ever truly loved was Daniella.\nStephen saying \"Let's go home\" didn't seem to mean much to Abigail anymore.\nAbigail lowered her eyes and subtly avoided Stephen's hand. Her voice was distant. \"No thanks. I can carry it.\"\nStephen's hand hung in midair, frozen for a few seconds. The Abigail he remembered was easy to please. As long as he was a little nice to her, she would forget everything unpleasant, call him \"Stevie\" and cling to him sweetly.\nStephen had pictured her crying and thanking him for picking her up. But faced with her indifference, it hit him like a punch to the gut‚Äîsharp and suffocating.\nAfter all, Abigail was his real sister. Stephen held back his frustration and explained, \"Dani's been depressed since the car accident. Her mood's been all over the place.\n\"We've had to take turns staying with her so she wouldn't hurt herself. That's why we didn't come visit you.\"\nAs he spoke, something seemed to occur to him. He said, \"When you get back, don't stay in the main house. Go live in the nanny Georgia's room for a while, just in case Dani sees you and spirals again.\"\nWhen Abigail heard that, she only found it ironic. Daniella had killed someone, yet somehow ended up being the one everyone saw as the victim.\nThe whole family took turns looking after Daniella and they were so caught up in it that they forgot about Abigail, their actual flesh and blood sitting in prison. Even now that Abigail was coming home, they were still afraid she might upset Daniella.\nAbigail thought, 'I don't want this so-called home anymore. They can put me wherever they want‚Äîit doesn't matter.'\nA breeze passed through. Abigail rubbed her arms to fight the chill and responded in a low voice, \"Whatever you see fit.\"\nAside from that one glance at the beginning, she didn't look at Stephen again.\nStephen, however, suddenly remembered when Abigail was twelve. He had gone to pick her up, and she clung to his neck, timidly asking, \"Stevie, when I get home, will I have my own room?\"\nHe still remembered what he'd told her back then. He'd responded, \"You're the apple of our eye. You'll always stay in the biggest, nicest room.\"\nThat room was later given to Daniella. Abigail had cried and threw a fit over it for a long time. But now, it seemed like Abigail didn't care about anything anymore.\nStephen's chest tightened like it was stuffed with something heavy and suffocating. He frowned. \"If you're not happy about it, just tell me. I've got other properties. I can set you up somewhere else.\"\nAbigail shook her head. \"No need to trouble yourself, sir.\" That \"sir\" came from years of keeping her head down and knowing her place in prison.\nHowever, Stephen felt a rush of anger building inside. It sat heavy in his chest, hot and unsettled. \"You were only in prison for three years, doing just fine. But Dani nearly died multiple times.\n\"You can only blame yourself for dragging us to that stupid graduation ceremony. Dani only got into that accident because of you. She's not complaining, so what are you acting all high and mighty for?\n\"Did you forget what kind of life you had in the orphanage? Did we ever let you go without food or clothes under our roof? Don't be so ungrateful.\n\"If it weren't for the fact that you have to personally call off the engagement with the Fletcher family's heir, you think I'd waste my time picking you up?\"\nAfter he said that, Stephen turned without hesitation and slammed the car door shut. He didn't even look at Abigail as he started the engine and drove off without the slightest intention of waiting for her.\nAbigail hadn't expected anyone to pick her up anyway, so she wasn't particularly hurt by it.\nShe just found it ironic. Abigail had thought Stephen came to pick her up out of some sense of blood ties or decency, but it turned out he was only here to make sure she broke off the engagement with the Fletcher family's heir.\nThat engagement had been arranged by Abigail's grandfather, Wyatt, when she was a child. It was originally intended for Daniella. But after Abigail returned, Wyatt insisted on replacing Daniella with Abigail as the one engaged to the Fletcher boy.\nBecause of this, everyone hated Abigail for stealing Daniella's Fianc√©. Even the Fletcher heir himself, Ralph Fletcher, believed Abigail deliberately came between him and Daniella, and despised her for it.\nNow, Abigail was someone who'd served three years in prison, while Ralph had taken over the Fletcher family and was now firmly in charge. He was completely out of her league.\nAbigail thought, 'This engagement should be called off. I have no reason to feel anything about it.'\nShe tightened her grip on the bag in her hand. There was a phone inside, but it had long since run out of battery, along with some spare change she was reluctant to spend on transportation.\nStephen told Abigail to figure it out herself, so she had no choice but to walk.\nIt wasn't until Abigail reached the foot of the hill that she realized Cobridge was no longer the place she remembered. She didn't know which direction the Gibson Villa was in.\nShe tried to find someone to ask, but the moment people saw the way she was dressed, they immediately recognized her as someone freshly released from the prison up the hill. Everyone avoided her like the plague.\nAbigail felt lost and unsure what to do, so she randomly picked a direction and started walking.\nJust then, a black sedan slowly pulled up beside her. A man's cool, composed voice came from inside. \"Ms. Gibson.\"\nChapter 2 The Stolen Fianc√©\nThe black car blocked the road ahead. The window rolled down, revealing half of the man's face. To Abigail, that face was all too familiar.\nRalph's voice was indifferent. \"You won't get to Gibson Villa going this way. Are you planning to walk all the way there?\"\nAbigail looked at him, unsure how to respond. What she wanted was just to get far enough from the prison to find a ride home.\nRalph said, \"Cobridge has changed a lot in the past three years. You won't make it on foot. I'm heading to Gibson Villa.\"\nAbigail didn't understand. She thought, 'Is he offering me a ride?'\nShe stood there for a moment in a daze. Ralph looked more mature and composed now, no longer as unruly and arrogant as he had been three years ago. For a second, Abigail drifted into old memories and didn't know how to answer.\nRalph, however, had run out of patience. He got out of the car with a cold expression and stepped in front of her. \"Get in. I'll take you back. How much longer are you planning to stand here?\"\nHis words made Abigail fall silent. She didn't know why Ralph was here, and she didn't want to know. Thinking of her grandfather Wyatt, she turned and got into the car.\nInside, there was an unfamiliar, floral scent that made Abigail feel disoriented. She had sat in Ralph's car before. Back then, he'd always kept candy in the car, and it'd always had a sweet smell. The candy had been for her.\nBecause of that candy, Abigail had once believed she was special to Ralph. She had once been happy, thinking the feelings between them were mutual.\nBut the truth was, she had once heard him with her own ears, speaking about her to his friends with nothing but disdain.\nRalph had said, \"It's just some cheap candy. That's all it took to get her wrapped around my finger. I only gave it to her because I felt bad for her.\n\"That engagement? It was just some joke between our grandfathers. Besides, the Gibson family has more than one heiress.\"\nThe people around him had all agreed. In their eyes, Daniella, who had grown up with a wealthy upbringing, was a much better match for Ralph than Abigail. And Abigail, to them, was nothing more than someone Ralph humored because he happened to pity her.\nAbigail thought about how the gifts Ralph gave Daniella were nothing like the candy he used to give her. Now that Abigail looked back, it was clear how much‚Äîor how little‚ÄîRalph ever cared about her.\nAbigail never liked to force anything, not even an engagement that had originally belonged to her.\nShe had brought up ending it with Wyatt. Wyatt loved her and thought she'd been wronged, and wanted to go confront Ralph about it. She stopped him and asked for his agreement instead.\nWyatt agreed, but before the engagement could be called off, she ended up taking Daniella's place and going to prison.\nIt was only then that Abigail realized she was never that important to them. To be honest, aside from Wyatt, everyone else in the Gibson family‚Äîand Ralph‚Äînever truly welcomed her. She was like an intruder who had disturbed their perfect little family.\nThey never said it outright, but everything they did made it clear they wanted her gone. And yet it wasn't like she had done anything wrong.\nAbigail had grown up struggling to survive in an orphanage. Even after being adopted, she lived cautiously.\nShe once thought her birth parents must have really loved her to go through all that effort to find her. But reality hit her hard.\nThey already had an adopted daughter they adored, showered her with affection. Abigail wasn't like that‚Äîshe'd grown up scraping by with nothing.\nThey looked down on Abigail, treated her like she didn't belong. If it hadn't been for the blood tie, they wouldn't have wanted her at all.\nBack then, only Ralph had paid attention to Abigail's mood when she was feeling down. He'd offer her candy to cheer her up. To her, Ralph was like the light of her life. But that light only touched her for a brief moment.\nThree years in prison was enough to repay whatever debt she owed the Gibsons for bringing her into this world. As for that so-called family, she didn't want it anymore. She didn't want Ralph either.\nThe car pulled into Gibson Villa. As it came to a stop, a girl in a white dress walked over with a bright smile on her pretty face. \"Ralphie, what took you so long? Stevie and I have been waiting for you forever.\"\nStephen followed right behind, draping a coat over her shoulders.\nDaniella's smile froze the moment she saw Abigail. Her eyes turned slightly red, like she had been wronged.\n\"Abigail? Why are you in Ralph's car?\" Stephen questioned right away, his brows furrowed in what looked like obvious displeasure.\n\"I ran into her on my way here. Didn't you send someone to pick her up?\" Ralph asked. His words made Stephen fall silent.\nStephen thought, 'What am I supposed to say? That I did go but left her behind because I was pissed off by her attitude?'\n\"Stevie must've forgotten,\" Daniella said lightly. \"Abby, why didn't you call us? Good thing Ralphie ran into you.\"\nTo anyone listening, Daniella sounded kind and considerate. Abigail had thought the same when she first returned to the Gibson family.\nBut after being falsely accused by Daniella again and again, she finally saw it clearly. Some people were just good at pretending to be nice, always appearing soft and understanding.\nAnd the Gibson family fell for it every time. To them, Daniella was exactly the kind of daughter and sister they wanted.\n\"Abby, it's so good to have you back. I'm really happy, and so are Mom, Dad, and all our brothers,\" Daniella said with a radiant smile. Stephen looked at her with obvious affection in his eyes.\nAbigail didn't know and didn't care whether the Gibson family was happy. The only person she cared about was Wyatt. She knew Wyatt would be thrilled to see her. A hint of urgency started to build in Abigail's chest.\n\"Abigail, Dani's talking to you. Didn't you hear her?\" Stephen snapped, glaring at her like she was his enemy.\nDaniella bit her lip and tugged on Stephen's sleeve. \"Stevie, don't be like that. Abby never liked me. It's normal for her to ignore me. I'm used to it.\"\nStephen got even angrier and shouted at Abigail, \"Dani doesn't owe you anything.\"\nAbigail just found it ridiculous. \"She doesn't owe me anything, so you think I owe her instead?\"\nChapter 3 The Apple Of Their Eye\nIn the eyes of the Gibson family, Abigail owed Daniella just for coming back‚Äîbecause Daniella had gone from being the real heiress to the adopted one because of her.\nBut none of that was Abigail's choice. It wasn't her who found the Gibson family. They were the ones who found her. They brought her home, only to treat her like she didn't belong.\nAbigail felt confused and thought, 'If they think Daniella is so perfect that she could take the place of their real flesh and blood, then why bother looking for me and bringing me back?\n'Was it just so I could watch them spoil Daniella to her heart's content?'\nThe sarcasm in Abigail's eyes was obvious, and it made Stephen furious. His face darkened. \"If you hadn't been so reckless and selfish, Dani wouldn't have ended up in that mess.\"\n\"What mess?\" Abigail shot back.\nDaniella's expression changed instantly. \"Stevie, today's Abby's homecoming. Let's not bring up the past.\" She turned to Ralph. \"Ralphie, didn't you say you wanted to meet my grandpa? Let's go.\"\nRalph looked at Abigail, his eyes brooding and unreadable. \"You're not coming?\" he asked indifferently.\nAbigail's eyes lit up. She answered almost instinctively, \"I am.\"\nRalph gave a slight nod. \"Then let's go.\"\nAbigail was about to follow when Stephen suddenly grabbed her arm. His grip was so strong it made her frown in pain.\n\"You're planning to show up like that in front of Grandpa? What, trying to tattle on us again?\" Stephen sneered.\nAbigail didn't think there was anything wrong with what she was wearing. At least it was clean and tidy. But when it came to seeing Wyatt, she didn't want to argue with Stephen.\n\"I don't have a change of clothes,\" Abigail said.\nIn prison, she'd worn uniforms. She hadn't been allowed to wear her own clothes. The dress she had on now was the same one she'd worn three years ago. After being stored that long, it was faded and worn‚Äîunderstandably.\n\"Come with me,\" Stephen said, his gaze suddenly hard to read. Then he turned and walked away. Abigail followed behind him.\nAfter three years, the villa had changed a lot, and everything felt unfamiliar to Abigail.\nWhen they reached the second floor, Stephen's expression shifted slightly. \"You've been gone for three years, and no one's been using your room. We turned it into Dani's walk-in closet.\"\nAbigail paused for a moment, then gave a nod without much emotion. \"Got it.\"\nHer indifference, to Stephen, felt like she was giving him attitude again. He wanted to snap, but in the end, he knew they were in the wrong for how they had treated Abigail, so he held back.\nWith a grim expression, Stephen opened the door. Inside was an entire room turned into a walk-in closet. Transparent wardrobes lined the walls, filled with rows of clothes like a department store display, a clear sign of how much the Gibson family spoiled Daniella.\nStephen pulled out an outfit from a corner and tossed it to Abigail. \"These are clothes Dani doesn't like. She doesn't like anyone touching her stuff. You don't need to return it after you wear it. If you don't want it, throw it away.\"\nAbigail changed and came out. The fitted sweater hung a little loose on her, but she adjusted it quickly and stepped out. \"I'm done.\"\nStephen glanced at her, his expression hard to read. \"Let's go.\"\nAbigail didn't care about his cold attitude. Her heart was filled with excitement and nervousness at the thought of seeing Wyatt.\nStephen walked fast. Before Abigail could even catch up, he had already disappeared.\nAbigail didn't mind. She knew exactly where Wyatt lived. But just as she was about to step out of the villa, the joy bubbling in her chest vanished in an instant.\n\"Abby, you're finally home.\" Her mother, Bianca Gibson, teared up the moment she saw Abigail and choked up.\nBianca reached out to pull her into an embrace, but Abigail stepped back to avoid her.\nBianca's face fell. Her expression turned sorrowful. \"Abby, are you blaming me?\"\nAbigail didn't understand why Bianca would ask that and thought, 'Am I not supposed to blame her? They sent me to prison, made me suffer all that pain. I'm not allowed to blame them?'\n\"Mrs. Gibson, I'm going to see Grandpa.\" Abigail's voice was slightly hoarse.\nBianca looked like she had been dealt a heavy blow. Her whole body swayed. \"Abby, what did you just call me? You really are blaming me.\"\nTears streamed down Bianca's face. Even crying like this, she still looked elegant and beautiful, only now with a touch of fragility.\nWhen Abigail had first returned to the Gibson family, she used to really like Bianca. She thought Bianca was graceful, dignified, and kind.\nAbigail had hoped so many times that Bianca would speak to her the way she did to Daniella, with gentleness and affection.\nBut the only time Bianca had ever treated Abigail with that same softness was when she make Abigail go to prison in Daniella's place.\nAbigail thought, 'What a joke.'\n\"Mom, why are you crying?\" Daniella rushed over, full of concern as she came to Bianca's side.\nDaniella's voice quivered with emotion, and her eyes turned teary just like Bianca's. \"Abby, if you're mad, take it out on me. Just don't make Mom this sad.\n\"She's been skipping meals and losing sleep over you. She's already worn herself out. You may not care, but I do.\"\nBianca couldn't bear to see the adopted daughter she had lovingly raised in tears. She wiped her own tears away at once. \"Dani, I'm fine. Don't cry, sweetie. I'm okay.\"\n\"Mom, Abby has every right to resent me. If it weren't for me, she would've gotten all your love,\" Daniella said, biting her lip, her eyes brimming with tears, looking heartbreakingly pitiful.\n\"This isn't your fault, Dani. Don't overthink it,\" Bianca said patiently, comforting her. The two of them looked especially warm and close.\nChapter 4 Prison Life\nAbigail didn't want to see Bianca and Daniella putting on their sweet mother-daughter act.\nJust as Abigail walked past them, she saw Stephen coming from the other direction. He seemed to notice Bianca crying and quickened his pace, his tone sharp with anger. \"Abigail, what did you say to Mom?\"\nAbigail stared at him expressionlessly and asked calmly, \"Mr. Gibson, maybe you should ask your mother what she said to me. I only said one thing to her.\"\nStephen looked at Abigail with clear disbelief. He was about to say something when Bianca spoke up, \"Stevie, be nicer to Abby. I'm fine. I'm just really happy to see her again.\"\nStephen was scolded by Bianca and gave Abigail an annoyed look, but didn't say anything more.\n\"Abby, I got you new clothes and shoes. Why are you wearing something that doesn't even fit?\" Bianca glanced at Abigail, frowning slightly.\nAbigail looked up, her tone still laced with impatience. \"No need. This is fine. I'm going to see Grandpa.\"\nShe was about to leave, but Stephen reached out to block her and said, \"Grandpa's already sleeping.\"\n\"No way. Ralph is still with him, isn't he?\" Abigail's voice grew anxious. She hadn't seen Wyatt in three years, and now she was desperate to see him.\n\"Ralph already left,\" Stephen replied, clearly annoyed. He thought, 'If it weren't for her, Ralph would've stayed for dinner.'\n\"Abby, don't worry. You can see Grandpa tomorrow,\" Bianca said gently, trying to soothe Abigail.\nAbigail lowered her eyes in frustration. If it weren't for them, she would've made it in time to see Wyatt. She stayed quiet and turned to go inside.\n\"Abby, your room's all ready. Now that you're back, I really want to make things right,\" Bianca remarked softly.\nAbigail didn't react. She never planned to stay here in the first place. She just hadn't seen Wyatt yet.\n\"Okay,\" Abigail replied with a nod.\nBianca was overjoyed. Her eyes swept over the backpack in Abigail's hand, and a flash of pain crossed her expression. \"Stevie, is Abby's room all set up? Let her get some rest first.\"\nStephen looked a little uneasy. He answered, \"The room's not ready yet. Just let her stay in the maid's room for now.\"\n\"Stevie, what did you just say?\" Bianca looked like she couldn't believe what she was hearing. Stephen didn't say another word.\nAbigail spoke up, \"Where's the maid's room?\"\nShe didn't want to argue with them anymore. After getting an answer, she picked up her backpack and walked into the room on the first floor.\nBianca looked like she still wanted to say something, but when she thought of what Stephen had done, she stayed quiet.\nAbigail shut the door. The maid's room was simply furnished, but it had everything she needed. The Gibson family was wealthy, and even the maid's room wasn't small.\nAbigail wasn't picky about where she lived. She'd stayed in solitary confinement in prison before. In fact, the conditions here weren't bad at all.\nShe unpacked a little, took out her phone to charge it, and replied to a few messages. Then she heard a knock at the door.\n\"Abby, Mom asked me to call you for dinner.\" Daniella stood at the door with a bright smile.\nBut Abigail clearly saw the hostility hidden in Daniella's eyes. She replied, \"Got it. Let's go.\"\nAt the dinner table, Bianca enthusiastically placed food onto Abigail's plate. Abigail instinctively shielded her own plate and pulled away. A piece of broccoli fell onto the table.\nStephen's voice was low and laced with anger. \"Abigail, what are you dodging for? Mom's just trying to serve you.\"\n\"Sorry. It's a habit,\" Abigail said.\nShe really had gotten used to it. In prison, anytime someone reached over during meals, it was either to steal food from her plate or to throw trash onto it. If she didn't move fast enough, she wouldn't be able to eat at all.\nStephen let out a sharp laugh out of anger. \"Abigail, you're such a bad liar. You think we're actually going to believe that?\"\nAbigail put down her utensils and looked straight at him. \"Whether you believe it or not is up to you.\"\nBianca quickly stepped in. \"Stevie, Abby didn't mean anything by it. Come on, let's eat before the food gets cold.\"\nStephen held back his anger and stayed quiet, but the way he looked at Abigail felt like he was throwing knives at her.\nAbigail pretended not to notice. She'd seen worse‚Äîcrueler, darker stares than his. Compared to them, Stephen was nothing.\n\"Abby, why aren't you eating? Is the food not to your taste?\" Bianca looked at her, concerned.\nAbigail didn't know why Bianca was paying so much attention to her today. If this had been three years ago, she would've been thrilled, thinking Bianca had finally seen her, finally cared, finally wanted to be gentle with her.\nThree years ago, Abigail would've needed Bianca's attention. But now, she didn't.\n\"No, it's just a bit too heavy. I can't handle it,\" Abigail said.\nThe food on the table wasn't greasy, but everything had that sweet-and-spicy flavor Daniella liked.\nStephen couldn't help himself and sneered, \"Didn't you eat just fine before? Now suddenly you can't?\"\nAbigail looked up at him, her voice flat. \"Back then I hadn't starved myself sick. After three years in prison, being hungry became normal. Eating fast became normal. And getting stomach problems became normal, too.\"\nStephen froze. Bianca's eyes turned red as she asked, \"Abby, why didn't you call us and say something? I always thought you were doing fine in there.\"\nAbigail only found it ironic. 'How could prison life ever be fine?' she thought. They were the ones who sent her in, and after that, they didn't lift a finger to help.\nPrison was the kind of place where the strong thrived and the weak got crushed. Abigail had no money, no power. Getting pushed around was her everyday reality.\nAs for the phone calls, Abigail could only let out a cold laugh at the thought. \"I did call,\" she said.\n\"That's impossible,\" Stephen blurted out. \"No one at home ever got a call from you.\" As he spoke, he suddenly stopped.\nA trace of mockery appeared in Abigail's eyes. \"Two months after I went in, I called home. A maid answered. She told me you all said I should focus on serving my sentence and not call again.\"\nThe atmosphere at the table froze instantly.\n0:00 / 9:02",

Your family's here to pick you up. Be good from now on. Don't come back.\"\nAbigail mechanically took the storage box the guard handed her and gave a slight nod. She then followed the instructions to change out of her prison uniform and into the clothes she had worn when she arrived.\nThe short-sleeved dress had been sitting in storage for three years. The fabric was faded and worn, with several deep creases in the middle, and it hung loosely on her body.\nAbigail thought, 'Family?' She let out a cold, mocking laugh.\nThree years ago, the Gibson family had shown up at the orphanage with a paternity test, tearfully claiming that she was their long-lost heiress and brought her back to Cobridge.\nIt wasn't until she got there that Abigail found out her biological parents had adopted another daughter named Daniella Gibson to ease the pain of losing her.\nThe Gibson family had raised Daniella like a princess for fifteen years and couldn't bear to let her go.\nTo outsiders, they vaguely claimed Abigail had been sent to a village because of health reasons, while saying Daniella was her younger sister and still the youngest heiress of the Gibson family.\nBut then Daniella hit and killed someone with her car.\nThe Gibson family scolded Abigail, \"If you hadn't insisted we go to your graduation ceremony, we wouldn't have missed Dani's performance. She was distracted while driving because of that. This is your fault. You owe her.\"\nBefore Abigail could even protest, the Gibson family had already taken care of all the paperwork and thrown her in prison.\nAbigail thought, 'What family do I even have left?'\nThe prison gates slowly opened. Sunlight spilled in from outside, and Abigail squinted against the glare, spotting a man leaning against a car not far away.\nHe wore a beige long trench coat, a stark contrast to Abigail's thin dress, like they belonged to two different worlds.\nThat was Stephen Gibson, her biological second brother. The day she was brought back to the Gibson family, he was the one who'd picked her up, held her in his arms, and told her she'd now be the most cherished treasure of the Gibson household.\nBut later, it was Stephen who pinned down Abigail's hand and forced her to press her fingerprint on the confession letter just to protect Daniella.\nSeeing Abigail standing still, Stephen walked up to her and reached out to take her bag. \"Let's go home.\"\nAbigail gave a bitter smile. When she had first gone to prison, she used to imagine every day that the Gibson family would come to take her home.\nBut in prison, Abigail had been beaten until she vomited blood, starved until she had to crawl on the floor, and locked in the bathroom all night shivering from the cold.\nShe endured all of it and made it through three years, and not once did anyone from the Gibson family come to see her.\nNow Abigail had finally accepted the truth‚Äîthat between her and Daniella, the only one the Gibsons ever truly loved was Daniella.\nStephen saying \"Let's go home\" didn't seem to mean much to Abigail anymore.\nAbigail lowered her eyes and subtly avoided Stephen's hand. Her voice was distant. \"No thanks. I can carry it.\"\nStephen's hand hung in midair, frozen for a few seconds. The Abigail he remembered was easy to please. As long as he was a little nice to her, she would forget everything unpleasant, call him \"Stevie\" and cling to him sweetly.\nStephen had pictured her crying and thanking him for picking her up. But faced with her indifference, it hit him like a punch to the gut‚Äîsharp and suffocating.\nAfter all, Abigail was his real sister. Stephen held back his frustration and explained, \"Dani's been depressed since the car accident. Her mood's been all over the place.\n\"We've had to take turns staying with her so she wouldn't hurt herself. That's why we didn't come visit you.\"\nAs he spoke, something seemed to occur to him. He said, \"When you get back, don't stay in the main house. Go live in the nanny Georgia's room for a while, just in case Dani sees you and spirals again.\"\nWhen Abigail heard that, she only found it ironic. Daniella had killed someone, yet somehow ended up being the one everyone saw as the victim.\nThe whole family took turns looking after Daniella and they were so caught up in it that they forgot about Abigail, their actual flesh and blood sitting in prison. Even now that Abigail was coming home, they were still afraid she might upset Daniella.\nAbigail thought, 'I don't want this so-called home anymore. They can put me wherever they want‚Äîit doesn't matter.'\nA breeze passed through. Abigail rubbed her arms to fight the chill and responded in a low voice, \"Whatever you see fit.\"\nAside from that one glance at the beginning, she didn't look at Stephen again.\nStephen, however, suddenly remembered when Abigail was twelve. He had gone to pick her up, and she clung to his neck, timidly asking, \"Stevie, when I get home, will I have my own room?\"\nHe still remembered what he'd told her back then. He'd responded, \"You're the apple of our eye. You'll always stay in the biggest, nicest room.\"\nThat room was later given to Daniella. Abigail had cried and threw a fit over it for a long time. But now, it seemed like Abigail didn't care about anything anymore.\nStephen's chest tightened like it was stuffed with something heavy and suffocating. He frowned. \"If you're not happy about it, just tell me. I've got other properties. I can set you up somewhere else.\"\nAbigail shook her head. \"No need to trouble yourself, sir.\" That \"sir\" came from years of keeping her head down and knowing her place in prison.\nHowever, Stephen felt a rush of anger building inside. It sat heavy in his chest, hot and unsettled. \"You were only in prison for three years, doing just fine. But Dani nearly died multiple times.\n\"You can only blame yourself for dragging us to that stupid graduation ceremony. Dani only got into that accident because of you. She's not complaining, so what are you acting all high and mighty for?\n\"Did you forget what kind of life you had in the orphanage? Did we ever let you go without food or clothes under our roof? Don't be so ungrateful.\n\"If it weren't for the fact that you have to personally call off the engagement with the Fletcher family's heir, you think I'd waste my time picking you up?\"\nAfter he said that, Stephen turned without hesitation and slammed the car door shut. He didn't even look at Abigail as he started the engine and drove off without the slightest intention of waiting for her.\nAbigail hadn't expected anyone to pick her up anyway, so she wasn't particularly hurt by it.\nShe just found it ironic. Abigail had thought Stephen came to pick her up out of some sense of blood ties or decency, but it turned out he was only here to make sure she broke off the engagement with the Fletcher family's heir.\nThat engagement had been arranged by Abigail's grandfather, Wyatt, when she was a child. It was originally intended for Daniella. But after Abigail returned, Wyatt insisted on replacing Daniella with Abigail as the one engaged to the Fletcher boy.\nBecause of this, everyone hated Abigail for stealing Daniella's Fianc√©. Even the Fletcher heir himself, Ralph Fletcher, believed Abigail deliberately came between him and Daniella, and despised her for it.\nNow, Abigail was someone who'd served three years in prison, while Ralph had taken over the Fletcher family and was now firmly in charge. He was completely out of her league.\nAbigail thought, 'This engagement should be called off. I have no reason to feel anything about it.'\nShe tightened her grip on the bag in her hand. There was a phone inside, but it had long since run out of battery, along with some spare change she was reluctant to spend on transportation.\nStephen told Abigail to figure it out herself, so she had no choice but to walk.\nIt wasn't until Abigail reached the foot of the hill that she realized Cobridge was no longer the place she remembered. She didn't know which direction the Gibson Villa was in.\nShe tried to find someone to ask, but the moment people saw the way she was dressed, they immediately recognized her as someone freshly released from the prison up the hill. Everyone avoided her like the plague.\nAbigail felt lost and unsure what to do, so she randomly picked a direction and started walking.\nJust then, a black sedan slowly pulled up beside her. A man's cool, composed voice came from inside. \"Ms. Gibson.\"\nChapter 2 The Stolen Fianc√©\nThe black car blocked the road ahead. The window rolled down, revealing half of the man's face. To Abigail, that face was all too familiar.\nRalph's voice was indifferent. \"You won't get to Gibson Villa going this way. Are you planning to walk all the way there?\"\nAbigail looked at him, unsure how to respond. What she wanted was just to get far enough from the prison to find a ride home.\nRalph said, \"Cobridge has changed a lot in the past three years. You won't make it on foot. I'm heading to Gibson Villa.\"\nAbigail didn't understand. She thought, 'Is he offering me a ride?'\nShe stood there for a moment in a daze. Ralph looked more mature and composed now, no longer as unruly and arrogant as he had been three years ago. For a second, Abigail drifted into old memories and didn't know how to answer.\nRalph, however, had run out of patience. He got out of the car with a cold expression and stepped in front of her. \"Get in. I'll take you back. How much longer are you planning to stand here?\"\nHis words made Abigail fall silent. She didn't know why Ralph was here, and she didn't want to know. Thinking of her grandfather Wyatt, she turned and got into the car.\nInside, there was an unfamiliar, floral scent that made Abigail feel disoriented. She had sat in Ralph's car before. Back then, he'd always kept candy in the car, and it'd always had a sweet smell. The candy had been for her.\nBecause of that candy, Abigail had once believed she was special to Ralph. She had once been happy, thinking the feelings between them were mutual.\nBut the truth was, she had once heard him with her own ears, speaking about her to his friends with nothing but disdain.\nRalph had said, \"It's just some cheap candy. That's all it took to get her wrapped around my finger. I only gave it to her because I felt bad for her.\n\"That engagement? It was just some joke between our grandfathers. Besides, the Gibson family has more than one heiress.\"\nThe people around him had all agreed. In their eyes, Daniella, who had grown up with a wealthy upbringing, was a much better match for Ralph than Abigail. And Abigail, to them, was nothing more than someone Ralph humored because he happened to pity her.\nAbigail thought about how the gifts Ralph gave Daniella were nothing like the candy he used to give her. Now that Abigail looked back, it was clear how much‚Äîor how little‚ÄîRalph ever cared about her.\nAbigail never liked to force anything, not even an engagement that had originally belonged to her.\nShe had brought up ending it with Wyatt. Wyatt loved her and thought she'd been wronged, and wanted to go confront Ralph about it. She stopped him and asked for his agreement instead.\nWyatt agreed, but before the engagement could be called off, she ended up taking Daniella's place and going to prison.\nIt was only then that Abigail realized she was never that important to them. To be honest, aside from Wyatt, everyone else in the Gibson family‚Äîand Ralph‚Äînever truly welcomed her. She was like an intruder who had disturbed their perfect little family.\nThey never said it outright, but everything they did made it clear they wanted her gone. And yet it wasn't like she had done anything wrong.\nAbigail had grown up struggling to survive in an orphanage. Even after being adopted, she lived cautiously.\nShe once thought her birth parents must have really loved her to go through all that effort to find her. But reality hit her hard.\nThey already had an adopted daughter they adored, showered her with affection. Abigail wasn't like that‚Äîshe'd grown up scraping by with nothing.\nThey looked down on Abigail, treated her like she didn't belong. If it hadn't been for the blood tie, they wouldn't have wanted her at all.\nBack then, only Ralph had paid attention to Abigail's mood when she was feeling down. He'd offer her candy to cheer her up. To her, Ralph was like the light of her life. But that light only touched her for a brief moment.\nThree years in prison was enough to repay whatever debt she owed the Gibsons for bringing her into this world. As for that so-called family, she didn't want it anymore. She didn't want Ralph either.\nThe car pulled into Gibson Villa. As it came to a stop, a girl in a white dress walked over with a bright smile on her pretty face. \"Ralphie, what took you so long? Stevie and I have been waiting for you forever.\"\nStephen followed right behind, draping a coat over her shoulders.\nDaniella's smile froze the moment she saw Abigail. Her eyes turned slightly red, like she had been wronged.\n\"Abigail? Why are you in Ralph's car?\" Stephen questioned right away, his brows furrowed in what looked like obvious displeasure.\n\"I ran into her on my way here. Didn't you send someone to pick her up?\" Ralph asked. His words made Stephen fall silent.\nStephen thought, 'What am I supposed to say? That I did go but left her behind because I was pissed off by her attitude?'\n\"Stevie must've forgotten,\" Daniella said lightly. \"Abby, why didn't you call us? Good thing Ralphie ran into you.\"\nTo anyone listening, Daniella sounded kind and considerate. Abigail had thought the same when she first returned to the Gibson family.\nBut after being falsely accused by Daniella again and again, she finally saw it clearly. Some people were just good at pretending to be nice, always appearing soft and understanding.\nAnd the Gibson family fell for it every time. To them, Daniella was exactly the kind of daughter and sister they wanted.\n\"Abby, it's so good to have you back. I'm really happy, and so are Mom, Dad, and all our brothers,\" Daniella said with a radiant smile. Stephen looked at her with obvious affection in his eyes.\nAbigail didn't know and didn't care whether the Gibson family was happy. The only person she cared about was Wyatt. She knew Wyatt would be thrilled to see her. A hint of urgency started to build in Abigail's chest.\n\"Abigail, Dani's talking to you. Didn't you hear her?\" Stephen snapped, glaring at her like she was his enemy.\nDaniella bit her lip and tugged on Stephen's sleeve. \"Stevie, don't be like that. Abby never liked me. It's normal for her to ignore me. I'm used to it.\"\nStephen got even angrier and shouted at Abigail, \"Dani doesn't owe you anything.\"\nAbigail just found it ridiculous. \"She doesn't owe me anything, so you think I owe her instead?\"\nChapter 3 The Apple Of Their Eye\nIn the eyes of the Gibson family, Abigail owed Daniella just for coming back‚Äîbecause Daniella had gone from being the real heiress to the adopted one because of her.\nBut none of that was Abigail's choice. It wasn't her who found the Gibson family. They were the ones who found her. They brought her home, only to treat her like she didn't belong.\nAbigail felt confused and thought, 'If they think Daniella is so perfect that she could take the place of their real flesh and blood, then why bother looking for me and bringing me back?\n'Was it just so I could watch them spoil Daniella to her heart's content?'\nThe sarcasm in Abigail's eyes was obvious, and it made Stephen furious. His face darkened. \"If you hadn't been so reckless and selfish, Dani wouldn't have ended up in that mess.\"\n\"What mess?\" Abigail shot back.\nDaniella's expression changed instantly. \"Stevie, today's Abby's homecoming. Let's not bring up the past.\" She turned to Ralph. \"Ralphie, didn't you say you wanted to meet my grandpa? Let's go.\"\nRalph looked at Abigail, his eyes brooding and unreadable. \"You're not coming?\" he asked indifferently.\nAbigail's eyes lit up. She answered almost instinctively, \"I am.\"\nRalph gave a slight nod. \"Then let's go.\"\nAbigail was about to follow when Stephen suddenly grabbed her arm. His grip was so strong it made her frown in pain.\n\"You're planning to show up like that in front of Grandpa? What, trying to tattle on us again?\" Stephen sneered.\nAbigail didn't think there was anything wrong with what she was wearing. At least it was clean and tidy. But when it came to seeing Wyatt, she didn't want to argue with Stephen.\n\"I don't have a change of clothes,\" Abigail said.\nIn prison, she'd worn uniforms. She hadn't been allowed to wear her own clothes. The dress she had on now was the same one she'd worn three years ago. After being stored that long, it was faded and worn‚Äîunderstandably.\n\"Come with me,\" Stephen said, his gaze suddenly hard to read. Then he turned and walked away. Abigail followed behind him.\nAfter three years, the villa had changed a lot, and everything felt unfamiliar to Abigail.\nWhen they reached the second floor, Stephen's expression shifted slightly. \"You've been gone for three years, and no one's been using your room. We turned it into Dani's walk-in closet.\"\nAbigail paused for a moment, then gave a nod without much emotion. \"Got it.\"\nHer indifference, to Stephen, felt like she was giving him attitude again. He wanted to snap, but in the end, he knew they were in the wrong for how they had treated Abigail, so he held back.\nWith a grim expression, Stephen opened the door. Inside was an entire room turned into a walk-in closet. Transparent wardrobes lined the walls, filled with rows of clothes like a department store display, a clear sign of how much the Gibson family spoiled Daniella.\nStephen pulled out an outfit from a corner and tossed it to Abigail. \"These are clothes Dani doesn't like. She doesn't like anyone touching her stuff. You don't need to return it after you wear it. If you don't want it, throw it away.\"\nAbigail changed and came out. The fitted sweater hung a little loose on her, but she adjusted it quickly and stepped out. \"I'm done.\"\nStephen glanced at her, his expression hard to read. \"Let's go.\"\nAbigail didn't care about his cold attitude. Her heart was filled with excitement and nervousness at the thought of seeing Wyatt.\nStephen walked fast. Before Abigail could even catch up, he had already disappeared.\nAbigail didn't mind. She knew exactly where Wyatt lived. But just as she was about to step out of the villa, the joy bubbling in her chest vanished in an instant.\n\"Abby, you're finally home.\" Her mother, Bianca Gibson, teared up the moment she saw Abigail and choked up.\nBianca reached out to pull her into an embrace, but Abigail stepped back to avoid her.\nBianca's face fell. Her expression turned sorrowful. \"Abby, are you blaming me?\"\nAbigail didn't understand why Bianca would ask that and thought, 'Am I not supposed to blame her? They sent me to prison, made me suffer all that pain. I'm not allowed to blame them?'\n\"Mrs. Gibson, I'm going to see Grandpa.\" Abigail's voice was slightly hoarse.\nBianca looked like she had been dealt a heavy blow. Her whole body swayed. \"Abby, what did you just call me? You really are blaming me.\"\nTears streamed down Bianca's face. Even crying like this, she still looked elegant and beautiful, only now with a touch of fragility.\nWhen Abigail had first returned to the Gibson family, she used to really like Bianca. She thought Bianca was graceful, dignified, and kind.\nAbigail had hoped so many times that Bianca would speak to her the way she did to Daniella, with gentleness and affection.\nBut the only time Bianca had ever treated Abigail with that same softness was when she make Abigail go to prison in Daniella's place.\nAbigail thought, 'What a joke.'\n\"Mom, why are you crying?\" Daniella rushed over, full of concern as she came to Bianca's side.\nDaniella's voice quivered with emotion, and her eyes turned teary just like Bianca's. \"Abby, if you're mad, take it out on me. Just don't make Mom this sad.\n\"She's been skipping meals and losing sleep over you. She's already worn herself out. You may not care, but I do.\"\nBianca couldn't bear to see the adopted daughter she had lovingly raised in tears. She wiped her own tears away at once. \"Dani, I'm fine. Don't cry, sweetie. I'm okay.\"\n\"Mom, Abby has every right to resent me. If it weren't for me, she would've gotten all your love,\" Daniella said, biting her lip, her eyes brimming with tears, looking heartbreakingly pitiful.\n\"This isn't your fault, Dani. Don't overthink it,\" Bianca said patiently, comforting her. The two of them looked especially warm and close.\nChapter 4 Prison Life\nAbigail didn't want to see Bianca and Daniella putting on their sweet mother-daughter act.\nJust as Abigail walked past them, she saw Stephen coming from the other direction. He seemed to notice Bianca crying and quickened his pace, his tone sharp with anger. \"Abigail, what did you say to Mom?\"\nAbigail stared at him expressionlessly and asked calmly, \"Mr. Gibson, maybe you should ask your mother what she said to me. I only said one thing to her.\"\nStephen looked at Abigail with clear disbelief. He was about to say something when Bianca spoke up, \"Stevie, be nicer to Abby. I'm fine. I'm just really happy to see her again.\"\nStephen was scolded by Bianca and gave Abigail an annoyed look, but didn't say anything more.\n\"Abby, I got you new clothes and shoes. Why are you wearing something that doesn't even fit?\" Bianca glanced at Abigail, frowning slightly.\nAbigail looked up, her tone still laced with impatience. \"No need. This is fine. I'm going to see Grandpa.\"\nShe was about to leave, but Stephen reached out to block her and said, \"Grandpa's already sleeping.\"\n\"No way. Ralph is still with him, isn't he?\" Abigail's voice grew anxious. She hadn't seen Wyatt in three years, and now she was desperate to see him.\n\"Ralph already left,\" Stephen replied, clearly annoyed. He thought, 'If it weren't for her, Ralph would've stayed for dinner.'\n\"Abby, don't worry. You can see Grandpa tomorrow,\" Bianca said gently, trying to soothe Abigail.\nAbigail lowered her eyes in frustration. If it weren't for them, she would've made it in time to see Wyatt. She stayed quiet and turned to go inside.\n\"Abby, your room's all ready. Now that you're back, I really want to make things right,\" Bianca remarked softly.\nAbigail didn't react. She never planned to stay here in the first place. She just hadn't seen Wyatt yet.\n\"Okay,\" Abigail replied with a nod.\nBianca was overjoyed. Her eyes swept over the backpack in Abigail's hand, and a flash of pain crossed her expression. \"Stevie, is Abby's room all set up? Let her get some rest first.\"\nStephen looked a little uneasy. He answered, \"The room's not ready yet. Just let her stay in the maid's room for now.\"\n\"Stevie, what did you just say?\" Bianca looked like she couldn't believe what she was hearing. Stephen didn't say another word.\nAbigail spoke up, \"Where's the maid's room?\"\nShe didn't want to argue with them anymore. After getting an answer, she picked up her backpack and walked into the room on the first floor.\nBianca looked like she still wanted to say something, but when she thought of what Stephen had done, she stayed quiet.\nAbigail shut the door. The maid's room was simply furnished, but it had everything she needed. The Gibson family was wealthy, and even the maid's room wasn't small.\nAbigail wasn't picky about where she lived. She'd stayed in solitary confinement in prison before. In fact, the conditions here weren't bad at all.\nShe unpacked a little, took out her phone to charge it, and replied to a few messages. Then she heard a knock at the door.\n\"Abby, Mom asked me to call you for dinner.\" Daniella stood at the door with a bright smile.\nBut Abigail clearly saw the hostility hidden in Daniella's eyes. She replied, \"Got it. Let's go.\"\nAt the dinner table, Bianca enthusiastically placed food onto Abigail's plate. Abigail instinctively shielded her own plate and pulled away. A piece of broccoli fell onto the table.\nStephen's voice was low and laced with anger. \"Abigail, what are you dodging for? Mom's just trying to serve you.\"\n\"Sorry. It's a habit,\" Abigail said.\nShe really had gotten used to it. In prison, anytime someone reached over during meals, it was either to steal food from her plate or to throw trash onto it. If she didn't move fast enough, she wouldn't be able to eat at all.\nStephen let out a sharp laugh out of anger. \"Abigail, you're such a bad liar. You think we're actually going to believe that?\"\nAbigail put down her utensils and looked straight at him. \"Whether you believe it or not is up to you.\"\nBianca quickly stepped in. \"Stevie, Abby didn't mean anything by it. Come on, let's eat before the food gets cold.\"\nStephen held back his anger and stayed quiet, but the way he looked at Abigail felt like he was throwing knives at her.\nAbigail pretended not to notice. She'd seen worse‚Äîcrueler, darker stares than his. Compared to them, Stephen was nothing.\n\"Abby, why aren't you eating? Is the food not to your taste?\" Bianca looked at her, concerned.\nAbigail didn't know why Bianca was paying so much attention to her today. If this had been three years ago, she would've been thrilled, thinking Bianca had finally seen her, finally cared, finally wanted to be gentle with her.\nThree years ago, Abigail would've needed Bianca's attention. But now, she didn't.\n\"No, it's just a bit too heavy. I can't handle it,\" Abigail said.\nThe food on the table wasn't greasy, but everything had that sweet-and-spicy flavor Daniella liked.\nStephen couldn't help himself and sneered, \"Didn't you eat just fine before? Now suddenly you can't?\"\nAbigail looked up at him, her voice flat. \"Back then I hadn't starved myself sick. After three years in prison, being hungry became normal. Eating fast became normal. And getting stomach problems became normal, too.\"\nStephen froze. Bianca's eyes turned red as she asked, \"Abby, why didn't you call us and say something? I always thought you were doing fine in there.\"\nAbigail only found it ironic. 'How could prison life ever be fine?' she thought. They were the ones who sent her in, and after that, they didn't lift a finger to help.\nPrison was the kind of place where the strong thrived and the weak got crushed. Abigail had no money, no power. Getting pushed around was her everyday reality.\nAs for the phone calls, Abigail could only let out a cold laugh at the thought. \"I did call,\" she said.\n\"That's impossible,\" Stephen blurted out. \"No one at home ever got a call from you.\" As he spoke, he suddenly stopped.\nA trace of mockery appeared in Abigail's eyes. \"Two months after I went in, I called home. A maid answered. She told me you all said I should focus on serving my sentence and not call again.\"\nThe atmosphere at the table froze instantly.\n0:00 / 0:16",

Your family's here to pick you up. Be good from now on. Don't come back.\"\nAbigail mechanically took the storage box the guard handed her and gave a slight nod. She then followed the instructions to change out of her prison uniform and into the clothes she had worn when she arrived.\nThe short-sleeved dress had been sitting in storage for three years. The fabric was faded and worn, with several deep creases in the middle, and it hung loosely on her body.\nAbigail thought, 'Family?' She let out a cold, mocking laugh.\nThree years ago, the Gibson family had shown up at the orphanage with a paternity test, tearfully claiming that she was their long-lost heiress and brought her back to Cobridge.\nIt wasn't until she got there that Abigail found out her biological parents had adopted another daughter named Daniella Gibson to ease the pain of losing her.\nThe Gibson family had raised Daniella like a princess for fifteen years and couldn't bear to let her go.\nTo outsiders, they vaguely claimed Abigail had been sent to a village because of health reasons, while saying Daniella was her younger sister and still the youngest heiress of the Gibson family.\nBut then Daniella hit and killed someone with her car.\nThe Gibson family scolded Abigail, \"If you hadn't insisted we go to your graduation ceremony, we wouldn't have missed Dani's performance. She was distracted while driving because of that. This is your fault. You owe her.\"\nBefore Abigail could even protest, the Gibson family had already taken care of all the paperwork and thrown her in prison.\nAbigail thought, 'What family do I even have left?'\nThe prison gates slowly opened. Sunlight spilled in from outside, and Abigail squinted against the glare, spotting a man leaning against a car not far away.\nHe wore a beige long trench coat, a stark contrast to Abigail's thin dress, like they belonged to two different worlds.\nThat was Stephen Gibson, her biological second brother. The day she was brought back to the Gibson family, he was the one who'd picked her up, held her in his arms, and told her she'd now be the most cherished treasure of the Gibson household.\nBut later, it was Stephen who pinned down Abigail's hand and forced her to press her fingerprint on the confession letter just to protect Daniella.\nSeeing Abigail standing still, Stephen walked up to her and reached out to take her bag. \"Let's go home.\"\nAbigail gave a bitter smile. When she had first gone to prison, she used to imagine every day that the Gibson family would come to take her home.\nBut in prison, Abigail had been beaten until she vomited blood, starved until she had to crawl on the floor, and locked in the bathroom all night shivering from the cold.\nShe endured all of it and made it through three years, and not once did anyone from the Gibson family come to see her.\nNow Abigail had finally accepted the truth‚Äîthat between her and Daniella, the only one the Gibsons ever truly loved was Daniella.\nStephen saying \"Let's go home\" didn't seem to mean much to Abigail anymore.\nAbigail lowered her eyes and subtly avoided Stephen's hand. Her voice was distant. \"No thanks. I can carry it.\"\nStephen's hand hung in midair, frozen for a few seconds. The Abigail he remembered was easy to please. As long as he was a little nice to her, she would forget everything unpleasant, call him \"Stevie\" and cling to him sweetly.\nStephen had pictured her crying and thanking him for picking her up. But faced with her indifference, it hit him like a punch to the gut‚Äîsharp and suffocating.\nAfter all, Abigail was his real sister. Stephen held back his frustration and explained, \"Dani's been depressed since the car accident. Her mood's been all over the place.\n\"We've had to take turns staying with her so she wouldn't hurt herself. That's why we didn't come visit you.\"\nAs he spoke, something seemed to occur to him. He said, \"When you get back, don't stay in the main house. Go live in the nanny Georgia's room for a while, just in case Dani sees you and spirals again.\"\nWhen Abigail heard that, she only found it ironic. Daniella had killed someone, yet somehow ended up being the one everyone saw as the victim.\nThe whole family took turns looking after Daniella and they were so caught up in it that they forgot about Abigail, their actual flesh and blood sitting in prison. Even now that Abigail was coming home, they were still afraid she might upset Daniella.\nAbigail thought, 'I don't want this so-called home anymore. They can put me wherever they want‚Äîit doesn't matter.'\nA breeze passed through. Abigail rubbed her arms to fight the chill and responded in a low voice, \"Whatever you see fit.\"\nAside from that one glance at the beginning, she didn't look at Stephen again.\nStephen, however, suddenly remembered when Abigail was twelve. He had gone to pick her up, and she clung to his neck, timidly asking, \"Stevie, when I get home, will I have my own room?\"\nHe still remembered what he'd told her back then. He'd responded, \"You're the apple of our eye. You'll always stay in the biggest, nicest room.\"\nThat room was later given to Daniella. Abigail had cried and threw a fit over it for a long time. But now, it seemed like Abigail didn't care about anything anymore.\nStephen's chest tightened like it was stuffed with something heavy and suffocating. He frowned. \"If you're not happy about it, just tell me. I've got other properties. I can set you up somewhere else.\"\nAbigail shook her head. \"No need to trouble yourself, sir.\" That \"sir\" came from years of keeping her head down and knowing her place in prison.\nHowever, Stephen felt a rush of anger building inside. It sat heavy in his chest, hot and unsettled. \"You were only in prison for three years, doing just fine. But Dani nearly died multiple times.\n\"You can only blame yourself for dragging us to that stupid graduation ceremony. Dani only got into that accident because of you. She's not complaining, so what are you acting all high and mighty for?\n\"Did you forget what kind of life you had in the orphanage? Did we ever let you go without food or clothes under our roof? Don't be so ungrateful.\n\"If it weren't for the fact that you have to personally call off the engagement with the Fletcher family's heir, you think I'd waste my time picking you up?\"\nAfter he said that, Stephen turned without hesitation and slammed the car door shut. He didn't even look at Abigail as he started the engine and drove off without the slightest intention of waiting for her.\nAbigail hadn't expected anyone to pick her up anyway, so she wasn't particularly hurt by it.\nShe just found it ironic. Abigail had thought Stephen came to pick her up out of some sense of blood ties or decency, but it turned out he was only here to make sure she broke off the engagement with the Fletcher family's heir.\nThat engagement had been arranged by Abigail's grandfather, Wyatt, when she was a child. It was originally intended for Daniella. But after Abigail returned, Wyatt insisted on replacing Daniella with Abigail as the one engaged to the Fletcher boy.\nBecause of this, everyone hated Abigail for stealing Daniella's Fianc√©. Even the Fletcher heir himself, Ralph Fletcher, believed Abigail deliberately came between him and Daniella, and despised her for it.\nNow, Abigail was someone who'd served three years in prison, while Ralph had taken over the Fletcher family and was now firmly in charge. He was completely out of her league.\nAbigail thought, 'This engagement should be called off. I have no reason to feel anything about it.'\nShe tightened her grip on the bag in her hand. There was a phone inside, but it had long since run out of battery, along with some spare change she was reluctant to spend on transportation.\nStephen told Abigail to figure it out herself, so she had no choice but to walk.\nIt wasn't until Abigail reached the foot of the hill that she realized Cobridge was no longer the place she remembered. She didn't know which direction the Gibson Villa was in.\nShe tried to find someone to ask, but the moment people saw the way she was dressed, they immediately recognized her as someone freshly released from the prison up the hill. Everyone avoided her like the plague.\nAbigail felt lost and unsure what to do, so she randomly picked a direction and started walking.\nJust then, a black sedan slowly pulled up beside her. A man's cool, composed voice came from inside. \"Ms. Gibson.\"\nChapter 2 The Stolen Fianc√©\nThe black car blocked the road ahead. The window rolled down, revealing half of the man's face. To Abigail, that face was all too familiar.\nRalph's voice was indifferent. \"You won't get to Gibson Villa going this way. Are you planning to walk all the way there?\"\nAbigail looked at him, unsure how to respond. What she wanted was just to get far enough from the prison to find a ride home.\nRalph said, \"Cobridge has changed a lot in the past three years. You won't make it on foot. I'm heading to Gibson Villa.\"\nAbigail didn't understand. She thought, 'Is he offering me a ride?'\nShe stood there for a moment in a daze. Ralph looked more mature and composed now, no longer as unruly and arrogant as he had been three years ago. For a second, Abigail drifted into old memories and didn't know how to answer.\nRalph, however, had run out of patience. He got out of the car with a cold expression and stepped in front of her. \"Get in. I'll take you back. How much longer are you planning to stand here?\"\nHis words made Abigail fall silent. She didn't know why Ralph was here, and she didn't want to know. Thinking of her grandfather Wyatt, she turned and got into the car.\nInside, there was an unfamiliar, floral scent that made Abigail feel disoriented. She had sat in Ralph's car before. Back then, he'd always kept candy in the car, and it'd always had a sweet smell. The candy had been for her.\nBecause of that candy, Abigail had once believed she was special to Ralph. She had once been happy, thinking the feelings between them were mutual.\nBut the truth was, she had once heard him with her own ears, speaking about her to his friends with nothing but disdain.\nRalph had said, \"It's just some cheap candy. That's all it took to get her wrapped around my finger. I only gave it to her because I felt bad for her.\n\"That engagement? It was just some joke between our grandfathers. Besides, the Gibson family has more than one heiress.\"\nThe people around him had all agreed. In their eyes, Daniella, who had grown up with a wealthy upbringing, was a much better match for Ralph than Abigail. And Abigail, to them, was nothing more than someone Ralph humored because he happened to pity her.\nAbigail thought about how the gifts Ralph gave Daniella were nothing like the candy he used to give her. Now that Abigail looked back, it was clear how much‚Äîor how little‚ÄîRalph ever cared about her.\nAbigail never liked to force anything, not even an engagement that had originally belonged to her.\nShe had brought up ending it with Wyatt. Wyatt loved her and thought she'd been wronged, and wanted to go confront Ralph about it. She stopped him and asked for his agreement instead.\nWyatt agreed, but before the engagement could be called off, she ended up taking Daniella's place and going to prison.\nIt was only then that Abigail realized she was never that important to them. To be honest, aside from Wyatt, everyone else in the Gibson family‚Äîand Ralph‚Äînever truly welcomed her. She was like an intruder who had disturbed their perfect little family.\nThey never said it outright, but everything they did made it clear they wanted her gone. And yet it wasn't like she had done anything wrong.\nAbigail had grown up struggling to survive in an orphanage. Even after being adopted, she lived cautiously.\nShe once thought her birth parents must have really loved her to go through all that effort to find her. But reality hit her hard.\nThey already had an adopted daughter they adored, showered her with affection. Abigail wasn't like that‚Äîshe'd grown up scraping by with nothing.\nThey looked down on Abigail, treated her like she didn't belong. If it hadn't been for the blood tie, they wouldn't have wanted her at all.\nBack then, only Ralph had paid attention to Abigail's mood when she was feeling down. He'd offer her candy to cheer her up. To her, Ralph was like the light of her life. But that light only touched her for a brief moment.\nThree years in prison was enough to repay whatever debt she owed the Gibsons for bringing her into this world. As for that so-called family, she didn't want it anymore. She didn't want Ralph either.\nThe car pulled into Gibson Villa. As it came to a stop, a girl in a white dress walked over with a bright smile on her pretty face. \"Ralphie, what took you so long? Stevie and I have been waiting for you forever.\"\nStephen followed right behind, draping a coat over her shoulders.\nDaniella's smile froze the moment she saw Abigail. Her eyes turned slightly red, like she had been wronged.\n\"Abigail? Why are you in Ralph's car?\" Stephen questioned right away, his brows furrowed in what looked like obvious displeasure.\n\"I ran into her on my way here. Didn't you send someone to pick her up?\" Ralph asked. His words made Stephen fall silent.\nStephen thought, 'What am I supposed to say? That I did go but left her behind because I was pissed off by her attitude?'\n\"Stevie must've forgotten,\" Daniella said lightly. \"Abby, why didn't you call us? Good thing Ralphie ran into you.\"\nTo anyone listening, Daniella sounded kind and considerate. Abigail had thought the same when she first returned to the Gibson family.\nBut after being falsely accused by Daniella again and again, she finally saw it clearly. Some people were just good at pretending to be nice, always appearing soft and understanding.\nAnd the Gibson family fell for it every time. To them, Daniella was exactly the kind of daughter and sister they wanted.\n\"Abby, it's so good to have you back. I'm really happy, and so are Mom, Dad, and all our brothers,\" Daniella said with a radiant smile. Stephen looked at her with obvious affection in his eyes.\nAbigail didn't know and didn't care whether the Gibson family was happy. The only person she cared about was Wyatt. She knew Wyatt would be thrilled to see her. A hint of urgency started to build in Abigail's chest.\n\"Abigail, Dani's talking to you. Didn't you hear her?\" Stephen snapped, glaring at her like she was his enemy.\nDaniella bit her lip and tugged on Stephen's sleeve. \"Stevie, don't be like that. Abby never liked me. It's normal for her to ignore me. I'm used to it.\"\nStephen got even angrier and shouted at Abigail, \"Dani doesn't owe you anything.\"\nAbigail just found it ridiculous. \"She doesn't owe me anything, so you think I owe her instead?\"\nChapter 3 The Apple Of Their Eye\nIn the eyes of the Gibson family, Abigail owed Daniella just for coming back‚Äîbecause Daniella had gone from being the real heiress to the adopted one because of her.\nBut none of that was Abigail's choice. It wasn't her who found the Gibson family. They were the ones who found her. They brought her home, only to treat her like she didn't belong.\nAbigail felt confused and thought, 'If they think Daniella is so perfect that she could take the place of their real flesh and blood, then why bother looking for me and bringing me back?\n'Was it just so I could watch them spoil Daniella to her heart's content?'\nThe sarcasm in Abigail's eyes was obvious, and it made Stephen furious. His face darkened. \"If you hadn't been so reckless and selfish, Dani wouldn't have ended up in that mess.\"\n\"What mess?\" Abigail shot back.\nDaniella's expression changed instantly. \"Stevie, today's Abby's homecoming. Let's not bring up the past.\" She turned to Ralph. \"Ralphie, didn't you say you wanted to meet my grandpa? Let's go.\"\nRalph looked at Abigail, his eyes brooding and unreadable. \"You're not coming?\" he asked indifferently.\nAbigail's eyes lit up. She answered almost instinctively, \"I am.\"\nRalph gave a slight nod. \"Then let's go.\"\nAbigail was about to follow when Stephen suddenly grabbed her arm. His grip was so strong it made her frown in pain.\n\"You're planning to show up like that in front of Grandpa? What, trying to tattle on us again?\" Stephen sneered.\nAbigail didn't think there was anything wrong with what she was wearing. At least it was clean and tidy. But when it came to seeing Wyatt, she didn't want to argue with Stephen.\n\"I don't have a change of clothes,\" Abigail said.\nIn prison, she'd worn uniforms. She hadn't been allowed to wear her own clothes. The dress she had on now was the same one she'd worn three years ago. After being stored that long, it was faded and worn‚Äîunderstandably.\n\"Come with me,\" Stephen said, his gaze suddenly hard to read. Then he turned and walked away. Abigail followed behind him.\nAfter three years, the villa had changed a lot, and everything felt unfamiliar to Abigail.\nWhen they reached the second floor, Stephen's expression shifted slightly. \"You've been gone for three years, and no one's been using your room. We turned it into Dani's walk-in closet.\"\nAbigail paused for a moment, then gave a nod without much emotion. \"Got it.\"\nHer indifference, to Stephen, felt like she was giving him attitude again. He wanted to snap, but in the end, he knew they were in the wrong for how they had treated Abigail, so he held back.\nWith a grim expression, Stephen opened the door. Inside was an entire room turned into a walk-in closet. Transparent wardrobes lined the walls, filled with rows of clothes like a department store display, a clear sign of how much the Gibson family spoiled Daniella.\nStephen pulled out an outfit from a corner and tossed it to Abigail. \"These are clothes Dani doesn't like. She doesn't like anyone touching her stuff. You don't need to return it after you wear it. If you don't want it, throw it away.\"\nAbigail changed and came out. The fitted sweater hung a little loose on her, but she adjusted it quickly and stepped out. \"I'm done.\"\nStephen glanced at her, his expression hard to read. \"Let's go.\"\nAbigail didn't care about his cold attitude. Her heart was filled with excitement and nervousness at the thought of seeing Wyatt.\nStephen walked fast. Before Abigail could even catch up, he had already disappeared.\nAbigail didn't mind. She knew exactly where Wyatt lived. But just as she was about to step out of the villa, the joy bubbling in her chest vanished in an instant.\n\"Abby, you're finally home.\" Her mother, Bianca Gibson, teared up the moment she saw Abigail and choked up.\nBianca reached out to pull her into an embrace, but Abigail stepped back to avoid her.\nBianca's face fell. Her expression turned sorrowful. \"Abby, are you blaming me?\"\nAbigail didn't understand why Bianca would ask that and thought, 'Am I not supposed to blame her? They sent me to prison, made me suffer all that pain. I'm not allowed to blame them?'\n\"Mrs. Gibson, I'm going to see Grandpa.\" Abigail's voice was slightly hoarse.\nBianca looked like she had been dealt a heavy blow. Her whole body swayed. \"Abby, what did you just call me? You really are blaming me.\"\nTears streamed down Bianca's face. Even crying like this, she still looked elegant and beautiful, only now with a touch of fragility.\nWhen Abigail had first returned to the Gibson family, she used to really like Bianca. She thought Bianca was graceful, dignified, and kind.\nAbigail had hoped so many times that Bianca would speak to her the way she did to Daniella, with gentleness and affection.\nBut the only time Bianca had ever treated Abigail with that same softness was when she make Abigail go to prison in Daniella's place.\nAbigail thought, 'What a joke.'\n\"Mom, why are you crying?\" Daniella rushed over, full of concern as she came to Bianca's side.\nDaniella's voice quivered with emotion, and her eyes turned teary just like Bianca's. \"Abby, if you're mad, take it out on me. Just don't make Mom this sad.\n\"She's been skipping meals and losing sleep over you. She's already worn herself out. You may not care, but I do.\"\nBianca couldn't bear to see the adopted daughter she had lovingly raised in tears. She wiped her own tears away at once. \"Dani, I'm fine. Don't cry, sweetie. I'm okay.\"\n\"Mom, Abby has every right to resent me. If it weren't for me, she would've gotten all your love,\" Daniella said, biting her lip, her eyes brimming with tears, looking heartbreakingly pitiful.\n\"This isn't your fault, Dani. Don't overthink it,\" Bianca said patiently, comforting her. The two of them looked especially warm and close.\nChapter 4 Prison Life\nAbigail didn't want to see Bianca and Daniella putting on their sweet mother-daughter act.\nJust as Abigail walked past them, she saw Stephen coming from the other direction. He seemed to notice Bianca crying and quickened his pace, his tone sharp with anger. \"Abigail, what did you say to Mom?\"\nAbigail stared at him expressionlessly and asked calmly, \"Mr. Gibson, maybe you should ask your mother what she said to me. I only said one thing to her.\"\nStephen looked at Abigail with clear disbelief. He was about to say something when Bianca spoke up, \"Stevie, be nicer to Abby. I'm fine. I'm just really happy to see her again.\"\nStephen was scolded by Bianca and gave Abigail an annoyed look, but didn't say anything more.\n\"Abby, I got you new clothes and shoes. Why are you wearing something that doesn't even fit?\" Bianca glanced at Abigail, frowning slightly.\nAbigail looked up, her tone still laced with impatience. \"No need. This is fine. I'm going to see Grandpa.\"\nShe was about to leave, but Stephen reached out to block her and said, \"Grandpa's already sleeping.\"\n\"No way. Ralph is still with him, isn't he?\" Abigail's voice grew anxious. She hadn't seen Wyatt in three years, and now she was desperate to see him.\n\"Ralph already left,\" Stephen replied, clearly annoyed. He thought, 'If it weren't for her, Ralph would've stayed for dinner.'\n\"Abby, don't worry. You can see Grandpa tomorrow,\" Bianca said gently, trying to soothe Abigail.\nAbigail lowered her eyes in frustration. If it weren't for them, she would've made it in time to see Wyatt. She stayed quiet and turned to go inside.\n\"Abby, your room's all ready. Now that you're back, I really want to make things right,\" Bianca remarked softly.\nAbigail didn't react. She never planned to stay here in the first place. She just hadn't seen Wyatt yet.\n\"Okay,\" Abigail replied with a nod.\nBianca was overjoyed. Her eyes swept over the backpack in Abigail's hand, and a flash of pain crossed her expression. \"Stevie, is Abby's room all set up? Let her get some rest first.\"\nStephen looked a little uneasy. He answered, \"The room's not ready yet. Just let her stay in the maid's room for now.\"\n\"Stevie, what did you just say?\" Bianca looked like she couldn't believe what she was hearing. Stephen didn't say another word.\nAbigail spoke up, \"Where's the maid's room?\"\nShe didn't want to argue with them anymore. After getting an answer, she picked up her backpack and walked into the room on the first floor.\nBianca looked like she still wanted to say something, but when she thought of what Stephen had done, she stayed quiet.\nAbigail shut the door. The maid's room was simply furnished, but it had everything she needed. The Gibson family was wealthy, and even the maid's room wasn't small.\nAbigail wasn't picky about where she lived. She'd stayed in solitary confinement in prison before. In fact, the conditions here weren't bad at all.\nShe unpacked a little, took out her phone to charge it, and replied to a few messages. Then she heard a knock at the door.\n\"Abby, Mom asked me to call you for dinner.\" Daniella stood at the door with a bright smile.\nBut Abigail clearly saw the hostility hidden in Daniella's eyes. She replied, \"Got it. Let's go.\"\nAt the dinner table, Bianca enthusiastically placed food onto Abigail's plate. Abigail instinctively shielded her own plate and pulled away. A piece of broccoli fell onto the table.\nStephen's voice was low and laced with anger. \"Abigail, what are you dodging for? Mom's just trying to serve you.\"\n\"Sorry. It's a habit,\" Abigail said.\nShe really had gotten used to it. In prison, anytime someone reached over during meals, it was either to steal food from her plate or to throw trash onto it. If she didn't move fast enough, she wouldn't be able to eat at all.\nStephen let out a sharp laugh out of anger. \"Abigail, you're such a bad liar. You think we're actually going to believe that?\"\nAbigail put down her utensils and looked straight at him. \"Whether you believe it or not is up to you.\"\nBianca quickly stepped in. \"Stevie, Abby didn't mean anything by it. Come on, let's eat before the food gets cold.\"\nStephen held back his anger and stayed quiet, but the way he looked at Abigail felt like he was throwing knives at her.\nAbigail pretended not to notice. She'd seen worse‚Äîcrueler, darker stares than his. Compared to them, Stephen was nothing.\n\"Abby, why aren't you eating? Is the food not to your taste?\" Bianca looked at her, concerned.\nAbigail didn't know why Bianca was paying so much attention to her today. If this had been three years ago, she would've been thrilled, thinking Bianca had finally seen her, finally cared, finally wanted to be gentle with her.\nThree years ago, Abigail would've needed Bianca's attention. But now, she didn't.\n\"No, it's just a bit too heavy. I can't handle it,\" Abigail said.\nThe food on the table wasn't greasy, but everything had that sweet-and-spicy flavor Daniella liked.\nStephen couldn't help himself and sneered, \"Didn't you eat just fine before? Now suddenly you can't?\"\nAbigail looked up at him, her voice flat. \"Back then I hadn't starved myself sick. After three years in prison, being hungry became normal. Eating fast became normal. And getting stomach problems became normal, too.\"\nStephen froze. Bianca's eyes turned red as she asked, \"Abby, why didn't you call us and say something? I always thought you were doing fine in there.\"\nAbigail only found it ironic. 'How could prison life ever be fine?' she thought. They were the ones who sent her in, and after that, they didn't lift a finger to help.\nPrison was the kind of place where the strong thrived and the weak got crushed. Abigail had no money, no power. Getting pushed around was her everyday reality.\nAs for the phone calls, Abigail could only let out a cold laugh at the thought. \"I did call,\" she said.\n\"That's impossible,\" Stephen blurted out. \"No one at home ever got a call from you.\" As he spoke, he suddenly stopped.\nA trace of mockery appeared in Abigail's eyes. \"Two months after I went in, I called home. A maid answered. She told me you all said I should focus on serving my sentence and not call again.\"\nThe atmosphere at the table froze instantly.\n0:00 / 9:02",

        "primary_text": "Three months before the rejection, I applied for a transfer to the Crescent Moon Medical Center.\nOne month before the rejection, I mailed the rejection papers to Alpha Kane Ravencrest.\nThree days before the rejection, I packed all her belongings and moved out of The Ravencrest Pack.\nI decided to end the six-year bond when Kane appeared before me with his first love and her pup.\nThat was the moment my wolf finally howled the truth.\nSince he kept choosing them over me, his fated mate.\nI would set him free.\nWhen I truly vanished from his world, Kane's wolf went feral.\nI thought Kane would finally claim his first love as his new Luna.\nYet, surprisingly, this untouchable, powerful Alpha appeared before the media with bloodshot eyes, his voice breaking with raw vulnerability:\n\"I never betrayed our bond. I don't have any illegitimate pups. ‚Äù\n‚ÄúI just have a mate who left me. Her name is Aria Ashworth.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd my wolf is dying without her.\"\n\nThree months ago, the hospital director, Dr. Marcus Reed, held Aria's transfer application and looked at her in astonishment. \"Aria, are you certain about transferring to Crescent Moon Medical Center?\"\n\nAria's lashes fluttered as she smiled faintly, her expression tinged with the sorrow. \"I've made up my mind.\"\n\nHer wolf whimpered softly in her ch//est, sensing the finality in her decision.\n\nSeeing her determination, Marcus sighed and signed the paperwork.\n\nAs Aria left the director's office, she ran into Kane and Seraphina Cross in her white coat, with a little pup.\n\nShe paused in her tracks.\n\nThe scene before her could have been a perfect pack family portrait.\n\nSeraphina walked beside Kane, the boy beaming as he held both their hands.\n\nThe sight pierced Aria's heart like silver.\n\nKane's patience and tenderness toward them were things she'd never experienced, not even during their heat cycles.\n\nShe knew he resented their forced bond.\n\nSeraphina had been Kane's first love. Aria only learned they'd separated after she was bonded to Kane through a deal with his grandmother.\n\nTo Kane, she was the scheming wolf who'd stolen him away through manipulation. He never knew the truth‚Äîthat she'd met him long before Seraphina, though he didn't remember their first encounter under the blood moon.\n\nShe'd believed their mating bond would make him recall their past and win his heart.\n\nBut she was completely wrong.\n\nHe despised her with the fury of a caged Alpha.\n\nHow could love grow from such hatred?\n\nFor six years, he'd claimed to be unmated in public, pretending not to recognize her scent. The proof was undeniable.\n\n\"Dr. Ashworth?\" Seraphina greeted her.\n\nKane frowned, his amber eyes sharp as if warning Aria against revealing their bond.\n\nThe distance in his gaze sent a pang through her heart, but she maintained her composure. \"Ms. Cross. Alpha Ravencrest.\"\n\nThe formal address made Kane's jaw tighten almost imperceptibly.\n\nKane had recently become an investor in Silverstone Medical Center. Aria knew he hadn't done it for her, but for Seraphina.\n\nSeraphina's return from studying abroad, her immediate position at the hospital, and her appointment as head of surgery made his motives clear as moonlight.\n\nEveryone in the hospital knew she had Alpha Kane's backing, and the recent rumors that he was Seraphina's chosen mate had never been addressed by him.\n\nSeraphina looped her arm through Kane's with practiced ease. \"No need for formalities, Dr. Ashworth. At the hospital, you're a veteran, and I still have a lot to learn from you.\"\n\nBefore Aria could respond, the boy tugged at Kane. \"Alpha Daddy, I'm tired. Can you carry me? Please?\"\n\nAria's expression dramatically changed at the term \"Daddy\".\n\nSeraphina feigned scolding. \"Jasper, you can't call him that!\" She turned to Kane apologetically. \"I'm sorry. He doesn't know better.\"\n\nKane glanced at Aria briefly, before effortlessly lifting the boy with neutral efficiency. \"It's fine.\"\n\n\"I like you. I wish you were my real daddy!\" Raven Cross clung to Kane's neck.\n\nSeraphina tapped the boy's nose playfully. \"Silly boy.\"\n\nAria clenched her fists until her nails drew blood, the metallic scent sharp in the air.\n\nThis gentle, patient side of Kane was one she'd never known.\n\nAria decided not to dwell on it.\n\nShe wouldn't warm his heart anyway.\n\nPerhaps this was the Moon Goddess's way of setting her free.\n\nSwallowing her pain like bitter wolfsbane, she stepped past them into the elevator.\n\n***\n\nAria hadn't made her job transfer application public, nor had she told Kane, because she thought it was unnecessary.\n\nHe likely wouldn't care anyway. His wolf had never shown interest in her movements.\n\nHer car pulled up to Ravencrest Manor, where she rang the bell with hands that trembled slightly.\n\nIn no time, the housekeeper, Margaret Hayes, came out to open the door. \"Luna Aria, you're back.\"\n\n\"Is Elder Ravencrest home?\"\n\n\"Yes, she's inside. Please come in.\" Margaret treated Aria with utmost respect due to the Alpha's mate.\n\nKane's grandmother, Eleanor Ravencrest, was a highly respected elder in the Ravencrest pack. Since her mate's passing, Eleanor had been the true power behind the pack's affairs.\n\nEleanor was  born into a powerful pack that controlled vast territories. In her youth, she had been a formidable Luna and shrewd pack politician. Even if Kane's mother disliked Aria, she wouldn't dare cross Aria in Eleanor's presence.\n\nMargaret led Aria to the meditation room where Eleanor knelt on a cushion, praying to the Moon Goddess.\n\n\"Elder Ravencrest, Luna Aria is here.\"\n\nEleanor opened her eyes slowly, her wolf-sharp gaze assessing. \"Come sit.\"\n\nAfter Margaret left, Aria knelt beside Eleanor, bowing devoutly before the silver statue of the Moon Goddess.\n\n\"Elder Ravencrest,\" Aria began, her voice steady despite her racing heart, \"I want to sever our bond with Kane.\"\n\nEleanor froze momentarily before meeting her gaze. \"This wasn't our agreement when we made our deal. Are you having second thoughts?\"\n\nYes, she was.\n\nAria lowered her eyes, suppressing the bitterness in them. \"I've disappointed you.\"\n\nEleanor closed her eyes briefly and sighed. \"Well. If that's what you want, go ahead and end your bond with him. Since I gave you the opportunity, but you still couldn't win his heart. Now our pack owes you nothing more.\"\n\nA heavy weight settled in Aria's ch//est like stones in a river. \"Thank you,\" she replied hoarsely, her wolf whimpering at the finality.\n\n***\n\nReturning to Moonrise Apartments, she coincidentally encountered Seraphina, her son, and Kane downstairs.\n\nThey had arrived in Kane's black Porsche, the scent of his cologne still lingering in the evening air.\n\nAria stood frozen.\n\nSeraphina looked at her in surprise. \"Dr. Ashworth? Do you live at Moonrise Apartments too?\"\n\nInstinctively, Aria glanced at Kane, but he showed no reaction.\n\nHis coldness cut deeper than silver claws.\n\nMoonrise Apartments was a luxury complex in Boston, one of the Ravencrest pack's properties. Kane had offered it to her as compensation for their forced bond.\n\nIt was close to the hospital, so she accepted it.\n\nShe never imagined he would move Seraphina and her son here as well.\n\nHow eager his wolf must be.\n\n\"What a coincidence,\" Aria murmured, suppressing her emotions.\n\nAs she turned to leave, Seraphina spoke again. \"Dr. Ashworth, I heard you're mated. Why haven't we seen your mate around?\"\n\nAria's steps faltered.\n\nHer gaze flickered to Kane, whose amber eyes darkened with displeasure.\n\nAria sneered inwardly. Was he really that afraid of Seraphina finding out about their mating bond?\n\n\"I don't have a mate,\" she stated flatly.\n\nA shadow passed through Kane's normally controlled eyes.\n\n\"But Dr. Ashworth, your records list you as mated,\" Seraphina said, her smile still in place but her eyes sharp as a blade.\n\nHer hospital records did indeed list her as bonded. Yet no one had ever seen her supposed mate.\n\nAria forced a mocking smile. \"I just wrote that for fun. I don't have a mate.\"\n\nKane's eyes narrowed dangerously at her denial.\n\nSince she'd already decided to leave, she didn't care anymore about keeping her mating status a secret.\n\nWithout another glance at the group behind her, Aria strode into the apartment building.\n\nIn the evening, Aria packed all her personal belongings into two large suitcases and stored them in the walk-in closet.\n\nHer gaze fell on the photo frame of their mating ceremony, in which she was wearing a white dress, holding Kane's hand, smiling beautifully, in stark contrast to his cold, serious face.\n\nBack then, she'd simply thought he just didn't like showing emotion. Though it was their only photo together as bonded mates, she'd treasured it.\n\nBut now, it just seemed like a mockery of the Moon Goddess's gift.\n\nIt wasn't that he disliked showing warmth. She just hadn't been worthy of his smiles.\n\nPicking up the photo for one last look, she tossed it into a cardboard box with other discarded items, sealing them away in the closet.\n\nAs she exited the bedroom, sounds and familiar scent from the living room caught her attention. Kane had returned.\n\nEntering the living area, she saw him hanging his coat on the entryway rack and changing his shoes.\n\nAria took a deep breath and approached him.\n\n\"Don't you have any explanation for today?\" she asked, referring to his decision to move Seraphina and her son into Moonrise Apartments, too.\n\nKane removed his tie, his amber eyes cold. \"Explain what?\"\n\n\"The apartments are close to the hospital. If you can live there, why can't they?\"\n\nHe draped the tie over his arm and stared at her. \"Aria, you got what you wanted. Don't be petty.\"\n\nAria was devastated by his words. Her wolf whimpering inside.\n\nGot what she wanted?\n\nIn his eyes, she had already obtained the position of Luna. Any objection to Seraphina and her son moving in must seem like petty jealousy to him.\n\nAs he turned toward the bedroom, Aria stopped him. \"We need to talk.\"\n\nKane paused and turned back impatiently, his gaze indifferent. \"What now?\"\n\n\"Let's sever our bond.\" Aria slowly removed her Luna ring and clenched it in her palm. \"I'm setting you free.\"",

        "primary_text": "Three months before the rejection, I applied for a transfer to the Crescent Moon Medical Center.\nOne month before the rejection, I mailed the rejection papers to Alpha Kane Ravencrest.\nThree days before the rejection, I packed all her belongings and moved out of The Ravencrest Pack.\nI decided to end the six-year bond when Kane appeared before me with his first love and her pup.\nThat was the moment my wolf finally howled the truth.\nSince he kept choosing them over me, his fated mate.\nI would set him free.\nWhen I truly vanished from his world, Kane's wolf went feral.\nI thought Kane would finally claim his first love as his new Luna.\nYet, surprisingly, this untouchable, powerful Alpha appeared before the media with bloodshot eyes, his voice breaking with raw vulnerability:\n\"I never betrayed our bond. I don't have any illegitimate pups. ‚Äù\n‚ÄúI just have a mate who left me. Her name is Aria Ashworth.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd my wolf is dying without her.\"\n\nThree months ago, the hospital director, Dr. Marcus Reed, held Aria's transfer application and looked at her in astonishment. \"Aria, are you certain about transferring to Crescent Moon Medical Center?\"\n\nAria's lashes fluttered as she smiled faintly, her expression tinged with the sorrow. \"I've made up my mind.\"\n\nHer wolf whimpered softly in her ch//est, sensing the finality in her decision.\n\nSeeing her determination, Marcus sighed and signed the paperwork.\n\nAs Aria left the director's office, she ran into Kane and Seraphina Cross in her white coat, with a little pup.\n\nShe paused in her tracks.\n\nThe scene before her could have been a perfect pack family portrait.\n\nSeraphina walked beside Kane, the boy beaming as he held both their hands.\n\nThe sight pierced Aria's heart like silver.\n\nKane's patience and tenderness toward them were things she'd never experienced, not even during their heat cycles.\n\nShe knew he resented their forced bond.\n\nSeraphina had been Kane's first love. Aria only learned they'd separated after she was bonded to Kane through a deal with his grandmother.\n\nTo Kane, she was the scheming wolf who'd stolen him away through manipulation. He never knew the truth‚Äîthat she'd met him long before Seraphina, though he didn't remember their first encounter under the blood moon.\n\nShe'd believed their mating bond would make him recall their past and win his heart.\n\nBut she was completely wrong.\n\nHe despised her with the fury of a caged Alpha.\n\nHow could love grow from such hatred?\n\nFor six years, he'd claimed to be unmated in public, pretending not to recognize her scent. The proof was undeniable.\n\n\"Dr. Ashworth?\" Seraphina greeted her.\n\nKane frowned, his amber eyes sharp as if warning Aria against revealing their bond.\n\nThe distance in his gaze sent a pang through her heart, but she maintained her composure. \"Ms. Cross. Alpha Ravencrest.\"\n\nThe formal address made Kane's jaw tighten almost imperceptibly.\n\nKane had recently become an investor in Silverstone Medical Center. Aria knew he hadn't done it for her, but for Seraphina.\n\nSeraphina's return from studying abroad, her immediate position at the hospital, and her appointment as head of surgery made his motives clear as moonlight.\n\nEveryone in the hospital knew she had Alpha Kane's backing, and the recent rumors that he was Seraphina's chosen mate had never been addressed by him.\n\nSeraphina looped her arm through Kane's with practiced ease. \"No need for formalities, Dr. Ashworth. At the hospital, you're a veteran, and I still have a lot to learn from you.\"\n\nBefore Aria could respond, the boy tugged at Kane. \"Alpha Daddy, I'm tired. Can you carry me? Please?\"\n\nAria's expression dramatically changed at the term \"Daddy\".\n\nSeraphina feigned scolding. \"Jasper, you can't call him that!\" She turned to Kane apologetically. \"I'm sorry. He doesn't know better.\"\n\nKane glanced at Aria briefly, before effortlessly lifting the boy with neutral efficiency. \"It's fine.\"\n\n\"I like you. I wish you were my real daddy!\" Raven Cross clung to Kane's neck.\n\nSeraphina tapped the boy's nose playfully. \"Silly boy.\"\n\nAria clenched her fists until her nails drew blood, the metallic scent sharp in the air.\n\nThis gentle, patient side of Kane was one she'd never known.\n\nAria decided not to dwell on it.\n\nShe wouldn't warm his heart anyway.\n\nPerhaps this was the Moon Goddess's way of setting her free.\n\nSwallowing her pain like bitter wolfsbane, she stepped past them into the elevator.\n\n***\n\nAria hadn't made her job transfer application public, nor had she told Kane, because she thought it was unnecessary.\n\nHe likely wouldn't care anyway. His wolf had never shown interest in her movements.\n\nHer car pulled up to Ravencrest Manor, where she rang the bell with hands that trembled slightly.\n\nIn no time, the housekeeper, Margaret Hayes, came out to open the door. \"Luna Aria, you're back.\"\n\n\"Is Elder Ravencrest home?\"\n\n\"Yes, she's inside. Please come in.\" Margaret treated Aria with utmost respect due to the Alpha's mate.\n\nKane's grandmother, Eleanor Ravencrest, was a highly respected elder in the Ravencrest pack. Since her mate's passing, Eleanor had been the true power behind the pack's affairs.\n\nEleanor was  born into a powerful pack that controlled vast territories. In her youth, she had been a formidable Luna and shrewd pack politician. Even if Kane's mother disliked Aria, she wouldn't dare cross Aria in Eleanor's presence.\n\nMargaret led Aria to the meditation room where Eleanor knelt on a cushion, praying to the Moon Goddess.\n\n\"Elder Ravencrest, Luna Aria is here.\"\n\nEleanor opened her eyes slowly, her wolf-sharp gaze assessing. \"Come sit.\"\n\nAfter Margaret left, Aria knelt beside Eleanor, bowing devoutly before the silver statue of the Moon Goddess.\n\n\"Elder Ravencrest,\" Aria began, her voice steady despite her racing heart, \"I want to sever our bond with Kane.\"\n\nEleanor froze momentarily before meeting her gaze. \"This wasn't our agreement when we made our deal. Are you having second thoughts?\"\n\nYes, she was.\n\nAria lowered her eyes, suppressing the bitterness in them. \"I've disappointed you.\"\n\nEleanor closed her eyes briefly and sighed. \"Well. If that's what you want, go ahead and end your bond with him. Since I gave you the opportunity, but you still couldn't win his heart. Now our pack owes you nothing more.\"\n\nA heavy weight settled in Aria's ch//est like stones in a river. \"Thank you,\" she replied hoarsely, her wolf whimpering at the finality.\n\n***\n\nReturning to Moonrise Apartments, she coincidentally encountered Seraphina, her son, and Kane downstairs.\n\nThey had arrived in Kane's black Porsche, the scent of his cologne still lingering in the evening air.\n\nAria stood frozen.\n\nSeraphina looked at her in surprise. \"Dr. Ashworth? Do you live at Moonrise Apartments too?\"\n\nInstinctively, Aria glanced at Kane, but he showed no reaction.\n\nHis coldness cut deeper than silver claws.\n\nMoonrise Apartments was a luxury complex in Boston, one of the Ravencrest pack's properties. Kane had offered it to her as compensation for their forced bond.\n\nIt was close to the hospital, so she accepted it.\n\nShe never imagined he would move Seraphina and her son here as well.\n\nHow eager his wolf must be.\n\n\"What a coincidence,\" Aria murmured, suppressing her emotions.\n\nAs she turned to leave, Seraphina spoke again. \"Dr. Ashworth, I heard you're mated. Why haven't we seen your mate around?\"\n\nAria's steps faltered.\n\nHer gaze flickered to Kane, whose amber eyes darkened with displeasure.\n\nAria sneered inwardly. Was he really that afraid of Seraphina finding out about their mating bond?\n\n\"I don't have a mate,\" she stated flatly.\n\nA shadow passed through Kane's normally controlled eyes.\n\n\"But Dr. Ashworth, your records list you as mated,\" Seraphina said, her smile still in place but her eyes sharp as a blade.\n\nHer hospital records did indeed list her as bonded. Yet no one had ever seen her supposed mate.\n\nAria forced a mocking smile. \"I just wrote that for fun. I don't have a mate.\"\n\nKane's eyes narrowed dangerously at her denial.\n\nSince she'd already decided to leave, she didn't care anymore about keeping her mating status a secret.\n\nWithout another glance at the group behind her, Aria strode into the apartment building.\n\nIn the evening, Aria packed all her personal belongings into two large suitcases and stored them in the walk-in closet.\n\nHer gaze fell on the photo frame of their mating ceremony, in which she was wearing a white dress, holding Kane's hand, smiling beautifully, in stark contrast to his cold, serious face.\n\nBack then, she'd simply thought he just didn't like showing emotion. Though it was their only photo together as bonded mates, she'd treasured it.\n\nBut now, it just seemed like a mockery of the Moon Goddess's gift.\n\nIt wasn't that he disliked showing warmth. She just hadn't been worthy of his smiles.\n\nPicking up the photo for one last look, she tossed it into a cardboard box with other discarded items, sealing them away in the closet.\n\nAs she exited the bedroom, sounds and familiar scent from the living room caught her attention. Kane had returned.\n\nEntering the living area, she saw him hanging his coat on the entryway rack and changing his shoes.\n\nAria took a deep breath and approached him.\n\n\"Don't you have any explanation for today?\" she asked, referring to his decision to move Seraphina and her son into Moonrise Apartments, too.\n\nKane removed his tie, his amber eyes cold. \"Explain what?\"\n\n\"The apartments are close to the hospital. If you can live there, why can't they?\"\n\nHe draped the tie over his arm and stared at her. \"Aria, you got what you wanted. Don't be petty.\"\n\nAria was devastated by his words. Her wolf whimpering inside.\n\nGot what she wanted?\n\nIn his eyes, she had already obtained the position of Luna. Any objection to Seraphina and her son moving in must seem like petty jealousy to him.\n\nAs he turned toward the bedroom, Aria stopped him. \"We need to talk.\"\n\nKane paused and turned back impatiently, his gaze indifferent. \"What now?\"\n\n\"Let's sever our bond.\" Aria slowly removed her Luna ring and clenched it in her palm. \"I'm setting you free.\"\n0:00 / 0:11",

        "primary_text": "Three months before the rejection, I applied for a transfer to the Crescent Moon Medical Center.\nOne month before the rejection, I mailed the rejection papers to Alpha Kane Ravencrest.\nThree days before the rejection, I packed all her belongings and moved out of The Ravencrest Pack.\nI decided to end the six-year bond when Kane appeared before me with his first love and her pup.\nThat was the moment my wolf finally howled the truth.\nSince he kept choosing them over me, his fated mate.\nI would set him free.\nWhen I truly vanished from his world, Kane's wolf went feral.\nI thought Kane would finally claim his first love as his new Luna.\nYet, surprisingly, this untouchable, powerful Alpha appeared before the media with bloodshot eyes, his voice breaking with raw vulnerability:\n\"I never betrayed our bond. I don't have any illegitimate pups. ‚Äù\n‚ÄúI just have a mate who left me. Her name is Aria Ashworth.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd my wolf is dying without her.\"\n\nThree months ago, the hospital director, Dr. Marcus Reed, held Aria's transfer application and looked at her in astonishment. \"Aria, are you certain about transferring to Crescent Moon Medical Center?\"\n\nAria's lashes fluttered as she smiled faintly, her expression tinged with the sorrow. \"I've made up my mind.\"\n\nHer wolf whimpered softly in her ch//est, sensing the finality in her decision.\n\nSeeing her determination, Marcus sighed and signed the paperwork.\n\nAs Aria left the director's office, she ran into Kane and Seraphina Cross in her white coat, with a little pup.\n\nShe paused in her tracks.\n\nThe scene before her could have been a perfect pack family portrait.\n\nSeraphina walked beside Kane, the boy beaming as he held both their hands.\n\nThe sight pierced Aria's heart like silver.\n\nKane's patience and tenderness toward them were things she'd never experienced, not even during their heat cycles.\n\nShe knew he resented their forced bond.\n\nSeraphina had been Kane's first love. Aria only learned they'd separated after she was bonded to Kane through a deal with his grandmother.\n\nTo Kane, she was the scheming wolf who'd stolen him away through manipulation. He never knew the truth‚Äîthat she'd met him long before Seraphina, though he didn't remember their first encounter under the blood moon.\n\nShe'd believed their mating bond would make him recall their past and win his heart.\n\nBut she was completely wrong.\n\nHe despised her with the fury of a caged Alpha.\n\nHow could love grow from such hatred?\n\nFor six years, he'd claimed to be unmated in public, pretending not to recognize her scent. The proof was undeniable.\n\n\"Dr. Ashworth?\" Seraphina greeted her.\n\nKane frowned, his amber eyes sharp as if warning Aria against revealing their bond.\n\nThe distance in his gaze sent a pang through her heart, but she maintained her composure. \"Ms. Cross. Alpha Ravencrest.\"\n\nThe formal address made Kane's jaw tighten almost imperceptibly.\n\nKane had recently become an investor in Silverstone Medical Center. Aria knew he hadn't done it for her, but for Seraphina.\n\nSeraphina's return from studying abroad, her immediate position at the hospital, and her appointment as head of surgery made his motives clear as moonlight.\n\nEveryone in the hospital knew she had Alpha Kane's backing, and the recent rumors that he was Seraphina's chosen mate had never been addressed by him.\n\nSeraphina looped her arm through Kane's with practiced ease. \"No need for formalities, Dr. Ashworth. At the hospital, you're a veteran, and I still have a lot to learn from you.\"\n\nBefore Aria could respond, the boy tugged at Kane. \"Alpha Daddy, I'm tired. Can you carry me? Please?\"\n\nAria's expression dramatically changed at the term \"Daddy\".\n\nSeraphina feigned scolding. \"Jasper, you can't call him that!\" She turned to Kane apologetically. \"I'm sorry. He doesn't know better.\"\n\nKane glanced at Aria briefly, before effortlessly lifting the boy with neutral efficiency. \"It's fine.\"\n\n\"I like you. I wish you were my real daddy!\" Raven Cross clung to Kane's neck.\n\nSeraphina tapped the boy's nose playfully. \"Silly boy.\"\n\nAria clenched her fists until her nails drew blood, the metallic scent sharp in the air.\n\nThis gentle, patient side of Kane was one she'd never known.\n\nAria decided not to dwell on it.\n\nShe wouldn't warm his heart anyway.\n\nPerhaps this was the Moon Goddess's way of setting her free.\n\nSwallowing her pain like bitter wolfsbane, she stepped past them into the elevator.\n\n***\n\nAria hadn't made her job transfer application public, nor had she told Kane, because she thought it was unnecessary.\n\nHe likely wouldn't care anyway. His wolf had never shown interest in her movements.\n\nHer car pulled up to Ravencrest Manor, where she rang the bell with hands that trembled slightly.\n\nIn no time, the housekeeper, Margaret Hayes, came out to open the door. \"Luna Aria, you're back.\"\n\n\"Is Elder Ravencrest home?\"\n\n\"Yes, she's inside. Please come in.\" Margaret treated Aria with utmost respect due to the Alpha's mate.\n\nKane's grandmother, Eleanor Ravencrest, was a highly respected elder in the Ravencrest pack. Since her mate's passing, Eleanor had been the true power behind the pack's affairs.\n\nEleanor was  born into a powerful pack that controlled vast territories. In her youth, she had been a formidable Luna and shrewd pack politician. Even if Kane's mother disliked Aria, she wouldn't dare cross Aria in Eleanor's presence.\n\nMargaret led Aria to the meditation room where Eleanor knelt on a cushion, praying to the Moon Goddess.\n\n\"Elder Ravencrest, Luna Aria is here.\"\n\nEleanor opened her eyes slowly, her wolf-sharp gaze assessing. \"Come sit.\"\n\nAfter Margaret left, Aria knelt beside Eleanor, bowing devoutly before the silver statue of the Moon Goddess.\n\n\"Elder Ravencrest,\" Aria began, her voice steady despite her racing heart, \"I want to sever our bond with Kane.\"\n\nEleanor froze momentarily before meeting her gaze. \"This wasn't our agreement when we made our deal. Are you having second thoughts?\"\n\nYes, she was.\n\nAria lowered her eyes, suppressing the bitterness in them. \"I've disappointed you.\"\n\nEleanor closed her eyes briefly and sighed. \"Well. If that's what you want, go ahead and end your bond with him. Since I gave you the opportunity, but you still couldn't win his heart. Now our pack owes you nothing more.\"\n\nA heavy weight settled in Aria's ch//est like stones in a river. \"Thank you,\" she replied hoarsely, her wolf whimpering at the finality.\n\n***\n\nReturning to Moonrise Apartments, she coincidentally encountered Seraphina, her son, and Kane downstairs.\n\nThey had arrived in Kane's black Porsche, the scent of his cologne still lingering in the evening air.\n\nAria stood frozen.\n\nSeraphina looked at her in surprise. \"Dr. Ashworth? Do you live at Moonrise Apartments too?\"\n\nInstinctively, Aria glanced at Kane, but he showed no reaction.\n\nHis coldness cut deeper than silver claws.\n\nMoonrise Apartments was a luxury complex in Boston, one of the Ravencrest pack's properties. Kane had offered it to her as compensation for their forced bond.\n\nIt was close to the hospital, so she accepted it.\n\nShe never imagined he would move Seraphina and her son here as well.\n\nHow eager his wolf must be.\n\n\"What a coincidence,\" Aria murmured, suppressing her emotions.\n\nAs she turned to leave, Seraphina spoke again. \"Dr. Ashworth, I heard you're mated. Why haven't we seen your mate around?\"\n\nAria's steps faltered.\n\nHer gaze flickered to Kane, whose amber eyes darkened with displeasure.\n\nAria sneered inwardly. Was he really that afraid of Seraphina finding out about their mating bond?\n\n\"I don't have a mate,\" she stated flatly.\n\nA shadow passed through Kane's normally controlled eyes.\n\n\"But Dr. Ashworth, your records list you as mated,\" Seraphina said, her smile still in place but her eyes sharp as a blade.\n\nHer hospital records did indeed list her as bonded. Yet no one had ever seen her supposed mate.\n\nAria forced a mocking smile. \"I just wrote that for fun. I don't have a mate.\"\n\nKane's eyes narrowed dangerously at her denial.\n\nSince she'd already decided to leave, she didn't care anymore about keeping her mating status a secret.\n\nWithout another glance at the group behind her, Aria strode into the apartment building.\n\nIn the evening, Aria packed all her personal belongings into two large suitcases and stored them in the walk-in closet.\n\nHer gaze fell on the photo frame of their mating ceremony, in which she was wearing a white dress, holding Kane's hand, smiling beautifully, in stark contrast to his cold, serious face.\n\nBack then, she'd simply thought he just didn't like showing emotion. Though it was their only photo together as bonded mates, she'd treasured it.\n\nBut now, it just seemed like a mockery of the Moon Goddess's gift.\n\nIt wasn't that he disliked showing warmth. She just hadn't been worthy of his smiles.\n\nPicking up the photo for one last look, she tossed it into a cardboard box with other discarded items, sealing them away in the closet.\n\nAs she exited the bedroom, sounds and familiar scent from the living room caught her attention. Kane had returned.\n\nEntering the living area, she saw him hanging his coat on the entryway rack and changing his shoes.\n\nAria took a deep breath and approached him.\n\n\"Don't you have any explanation for today?\" she asked, referring to his decision to move Seraphina and her son into Moonrise Apartments, too.\n\nKane removed his tie, his amber eyes cold. \"Explain what?\"\n\n\"The apartments are close to the hospital. If you can live there, why can't they?\"\n\nHe draped the tie over his arm and stared at her. \"Aria, you got what you wanted. Don't be petty.\"\n\nAria was devastated by his words. Her wolf whimpering inside.\n\nGot what she wanted?\n\nIn his eyes, she had already obtained the position of Luna. Any objection to Seraphina and her son moving in must seem like petty jealousy to him.\n\nAs he turned toward the bedroom, Aria stopped him. \"We need to talk.\"\n\nKane paused and turned back impatiently, his gaze indifferent. \"What now?\"\n\n\"Let's sever our bond.\" Aria slowly removed her Luna ring and clenched it in her palm. \"I'm setting you free.\"\n\n„Äê7014„Äë",

        "primary_text": "Three months before the rejection, I applied for a transfer to the Crescent Moon Medical Center.\nOne month before the rejection, I mailed the rejection papers to Alpha Kane Ravencrest.\nThree days before the rejection, I packed all her belongings and moved out of The Ravencrest Pack.\nI decided to end the six-year bond when Kane appeared before me with his first love and her pup.\nThat was the moment my wolf finally howled the truth.\nSince he kept choosing them over me, his fated mate.\nI would set him free.\nWhen I truly vanished from his world, Kane's wolf went feral.\nI thought Kane would finally claim his first love as his new Luna.\nYet, surprisingly, this untouchable, powerful Alpha appeared before the media with bloodshot eyes, his voice breaking with raw vulnerability:\n\"I never betrayed our bond. I don't have any illegitimate pups. ‚Äù\n‚ÄúI just have a mate who left me. Her name is Aria Ashworth.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd my wolf is dying without her.\"\n\nThree months ago, the hospital director, Dr. Marcus Reed, held Aria's transfer application and looked at her in astonishment. \"Aria, are you certain about transferring to Crescent Moon Medical Center?\"\n\nAria's lashes fluttered as she smiled faintly, her expression tinged with the sorrow. \"I've made up my mind.\"\n\nHer wolf whimpered softly in her ch//est, sensing the finality in her decision.\n\nSeeing her determination, Marcus sighed and signed the paperwork.\n\nAs Aria left the director's office, she ran into Kane and Seraphina Cross in her white coat, with a little pup.\n\nShe paused in her tracks.\n\nThe scene before her could have been a perfect pack family portrait.\n\nSeraphina walked beside Kane, the boy beaming as he held both their hands.\n\nThe sight pierced Aria's heart like silver.\n\nKane's patience and tenderness toward them were things she'd never experienced, not even during their heat cycles.\n\nShe knew he resented their forced bond.\n\nSeraphina had been Kane's first love. Aria only learned they'd separated after she was bonded to Kane through a deal with his grandmother.\n\nTo Kane, she was the scheming wolf who'd stolen him away through manipulation. He never knew the truth‚Äîthat she'd met him long before Seraphina, though he didn't remember their first encounter under the blood moon.\n\nShe'd believed their mating bond would make him recall their past and win his heart.\n\nBut she was completely wrong.\n\nHe despised her with the fury of a caged Alpha.\n\nHow could love grow from such hatred?\n\nFor six years, he'd claimed to be unmated in public, pretending not to recognize her scent. The proof was undeniable.\n\n\"Dr. Ashworth?\" Seraphina greeted her.\n\nKane frowned, his amber eyes sharp as if warning Aria against revealing their bond.\n\nThe distance in his gaze sent a pang through her heart, but she maintained her composure. \"Ms. Cross. Alpha Ravencrest.\"\n\nThe formal address made Kane's jaw tighten almost imperceptibly.\n\nKane had recently become an investor in Silverstone Medical Center. Aria knew he hadn't done it for her, but for Seraphina.\n\nSeraphina's return from studying abroad, her immediate position at the hospital, and her appointment as head of surgery made his motives clear as moonlight.\n\nEveryone in the hospital knew she had Alpha Kane's backing, and the recent rumors that he was Seraphina's chosen mate had never been addressed by him.\n\nSeraphina looped her arm through Kane's with practiced ease. \"No need for formalities, Dr. Ashworth. At the hospital, you're a veteran, and I still have a lot to learn from you.\"\n\nBefore Aria could respond, the boy tugged at Kane. \"Alpha Daddy, I'm tired. Can you carry me? Please?\"\n\nAria's expression dramatically changed at the term \"Daddy\".\n\nSeraphina feigned scolding. \"Jasper, you can't call him that!\" She turned to Kane apologetically. \"I'm sorry. He doesn't know better.\"\n\nKane glanced at Aria briefly, before effortlessly lifting the boy with neutral efficiency. \"It's fine.\"\n\n\"I like you. I wish you were my real daddy!\" Raven Cross clung to Kane's neck.\n\nSeraphina tapped the boy's nose playfully. \"Silly boy.\"\n\nAria clenched her fists until her nails drew blood, the metallic scent sharp in the air.\n\nThis gentle, patient side of Kane was one she'd never known.\n\nAria decided not to dwell on it.\n\nShe wouldn't warm his heart anyway.\n\nPerhaps this was the Moon Goddess's way of setting her free.\n\nSwallowing her pain like bitter wolfsbane, she stepped past them into the elevator.\n\n***\n\nAria hadn't made her job transfer application public, nor had she told Kane, because she thought it was unnecessary.\n\nHe likely wouldn't care anyway. His wolf had never shown interest in her movements.\n\nHer car pulled up to Ravencrest Manor, where she rang the bell with hands that trembled slightly.\n\nIn no time, the housekeeper, Margaret Hayes, came out to open the door. \"Luna Aria, you're back.\"\n\n\"Is Elder Ravencrest home?\"\n\n\"Yes, she's inside. Please come in.\" Margaret treated Aria with utmost respect due to the Alpha's mate.\n\nKane's grandmother, Eleanor Ravencrest, was a highly respected elder in the Ravencrest pack. Since her mate's passing, Eleanor had been the true power behind the pack's affairs.\n\nEleanor was  born into a powerful pack that controlled vast territories. In her youth, she had been a formidable Luna and shrewd pack politician. Even if Kane's mother disliked Aria, she wouldn't dare cross Aria in Eleanor's presence.\n\nMargaret led Aria to the meditation room where Eleanor knelt on a cushion, praying to the Moon Goddess.\n\n\"Elder Ravencrest, Luna Aria is here.\"\n\nEleanor opened her eyes slowly, her wolf-sharp gaze assessing. \"Come sit.\"\n\nAfter Margaret left, Aria knelt beside Eleanor, bowing devoutly before the silver statue of the Moon Goddess.\n\n\"Elder Ravencrest,\" Aria began, her voice steady despite her racing heart, \"I want to sever our bond with Kane.\"\n\nEleanor froze momentarily before meeting her gaze. \"This wasn't our agreement when we made our deal. Are you having second thoughts?\"\n\nYes, she was.\n\nAria lowered her eyes, suppressing the bitterness in them. \"I've disappointed you.\"\n\nEleanor closed her eyes briefly and sighed. \"Well. If that's what you want, go ahead and end your bond with him. Since I gave you the opportunity, but you still couldn't win his heart. Now our pack owes you nothing more.\"\n\nA heavy weight settled in Aria's ch//est like stones in a river. \"Thank you,\" she replied hoarsely, her wolf whimpering at the finality.\n\n***\n\nReturning to Moonrise Apartments, she coincidentally encountered Seraphina, her son, and Kane downstairs.\n\nThey had arrived in Kane's black Porsche, the scent of his cologne still lingering in the evening air.\n\nAria stood frozen.\n\nSeraphina looked at her in surprise. \"Dr. Ashworth? Do you live at Moonrise Apartments too?\"\n\nInstinctively, Aria glanced at Kane, but he showed no reaction.\n\nHis coldness cut deeper than silver claws.\n\nMoonrise Apartments was a luxury complex in Boston, one of the Ravencrest pack's properties. Kane had offered it to her as compensation for their forced bond.\n\nIt was close to the hospital, so she accepted it.\n\nShe never imagined he would move Seraphina and her son here as well.\n\nHow eager his wolf must be.\n\n\"What a coincidence,\" Aria murmured, suppressing her emotions.\n\nAs she turned to leave, Seraphina spoke again. \"Dr. Ashworth, I heard you're mated. Why haven't we seen your mate around?\"\n\nAria's steps faltered.\n\nHer gaze flickered to Kane, whose amber eyes darkened with displeasure.\n\nAria sneered inwardly. Was he really that afraid of Seraphina finding out about their mating bond?\n\n\"I don't have a mate,\" she stated flatly.\n\nA shadow passed through Kane's normally controlled eyes.\n\n\"But Dr. Ashworth, your records list you as mated,\" Seraphina said, her smile still in place but her eyes sharp as a blade.\n\nHer hospital records did indeed list her as bonded. Yet no one had ever seen her supposed mate.\n\nAria forced a mocking smile. \"I just wrote that for fun. I don't have a mate.\"\n\nKane's eyes narrowed dangerously at her denial.\n\nSince she'd already decided to leave, she didn't care anymore about keeping her mating status a secret.\n\nWithout another glance at the group behind her, Aria strode into the apartment building.\n\nIn the evening, Aria packed all her personal belongings into two large suitcases and stored them in the walk-in closet.\n\nHer gaze fell on the photo frame of their mating ceremony, in which she was wearing a white dress, holding Kane's hand, smiling beautifully, in stark contrast to his cold, serious face.\n\nBack then, she'd simply thought he just didn't like showing emotion. Though it was their only photo together as bonded mates, she'd treasured it.\n\nBut now, it just seemed like a mockery of the Moon Goddess's gift.\n\nIt wasn't that he disliked showing warmth. She just hadn't been worthy of his smiles.\n\nPicking up the photo for one last look, she tossed it into a cardboard box with other discarded items, sealing them away in the closet.\n\nAs she exited the bedroom, sounds and familiar scent from the living room caught her attention. Kane had returned.\n\nEntering the living area, she saw him hanging his coat on the entryway rack and changing his shoes.\n\nAria took a deep breath and approached him.\n\n\"Don't you have any explanation for today?\" she asked, referring to his decision to move Seraphina and her son into Moonrise Apartments, too.\n\nKane removed his tie, his amber eyes cold. \"Explain what?\"\n\n\"The apartments are close to the hospital. If you can live there, why can't they?\"\n\nHe draped the tie over his arm and stared at her. \"Aria, you got what you wanted. Don't be petty.\"\n\nAria was devastated by his words. Her wolf whimpering inside.\n\nGot what she wanted?\n\nIn his eyes, she had already obtained the position of Luna. Any objection to Seraphina and her son moving in must seem like petty jealousy to him.\n\nAs he turned toward the bedroom, Aria stopped him. \"We need to talk.\"\n\nKane paused and turned back impatiently, his gaze indifferent. \"What now?\"\n\n\"Let's sever our bond.\" Aria slowly removed her Luna ring and clenched it in her palm. \"I'm setting you free.\"\n\n„Äê7014„Äë\n0:00 / 0:07",

        "primary_text": "Chapter 1 Going Home\nIn the prison on the outskirts of Cobridge, the prison guard said, \"Inmate 847, Abigail Gibson. Your family's here to pick you up. Be good from now on. Don't come back.\"\nAbigail mechanically took the storage box the guard handed her and gave a slight nod. She then followed the instructions to change out of her prison uniform and into the clothes she had worn when she arrived.\nThe short-sleeved dress had been sitting in storage for three years. The fabric was faded and worn, with several deep creases in the middle, and it hung loosely on her body.\nAbigail thought, 'Family?' She let out a cold, mocking laugh.\nThree years ago, the Gibson family had shown up at the orphanage with a paternity test, tearfully claiming that she was their long-lost heiress and brought her back to Cobridge.\nIt wasn't until she got there that Abigail found out her biological parents had adopted another daughter named Daniella Gibson to ease the pain of losing her.\nThe Gibson family had raised Daniella like a princess for fifteen years and couldn't bear to let her go.\nTo outsiders, they vaguely claimed Abigail had been sent to a village because of health reasons, while saying Daniella was her younger sister and still the youngest heiress of the Gibson family.\nBut then Daniella hit and killed someone with her car.\nThe Gibson family scolded Abigail, \"If you hadn't insisted we go to your graduation ceremony, we wouldn't have missed Dani's performance. She was distracted while driving because of that. This is your fault. You owe her.\"\nBefore Abigail could even protest, the Gibson family had already taken care of all the paperwork and thrown her in prison.\nAbigail thought, 'What family do I even have left?'\nThe prison gates slowly opened. Sunlight spilled in from outside, and Abigail squinted against the glare, spotting a man leaning against a car not far away.\nHe wore a beige long trench coat, a stark contrast to Abigail's thin dress, like they belonged to two different worlds.\nThat was Stephen Gibson, her biological second brother. The day she was brought back to the Gibson family, he was the one who'd picked her up, held her in his arms, and told her she'd now be the most cherished treasure of the Gibson household.\nBut later, it was Stephen who pinned down Abigail's hand and forced her to press her fingerprint on the confession letter just to protect Daniella.\nSeeing Abigail standing still, Stephen walked up to her and reached out to take her bag. \"Let's go home.\"\nAbigail gave a bitter smile. When she had first gone to prison, she used to imagine every day that the Gibson family would come to take her home.\nBut in prison, Abigail had been beaten until she vomited blood, starved until she had to crawl on the floor, and locked in the bathroom all night shivering from the cold.\nShe endured all of it and made it through three years, and not once did anyone from the Gibson family come to see her.\n0:00 / 9:02",

Our group is an open group where anyone can post their property listings for free and sell according to their suitability.\n\nThe purpose of this group is to provide homeowners, condo owners, and landowners in Pattaya with a direct channel to sell their properties, and it serves as a medium for buyers and tenants to find what they are looking for.\n\nWe do not allow individuals who are not related to real estate in Pattaya to post general products that are unrelated to the sale of houses, condos, land, or rental properties in Pattaya.\n\nThe seller is responsible for all the information they post. All information must be accurate. No money should be transferred before signing a contract, and the property must be viewed in person before making any payment. Do not trust scammers who may infiltrate the group. If you come across individuals who claim they can guarantee loan approvals or ask for a deposit without verifying any information, please report them to us. This is to prevent members from becoming victims of scams and selfish agents.",
