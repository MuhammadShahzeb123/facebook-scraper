            "primary_text": "NO APPLICATION FEE\n\nHello - My name is Philip, and I'm the landlord, not a property management company. I tell you this because I’m more interested in finding the right long-term tenant who fits into my small community than renting it to the first person who applies.\n\nI've learned the hard way that if I rent a place to the wrong person, it will change the dynamics of our entire community.\n\nUltimately, my goal is for you to love our company so much that you want to live in one of our units until you buy a home! If the place you rent from us is not ideal, we may have another property for you when your lease term is up.\n\nHere are some important points to understand about our process:\n\n* All the units are on lock-boxes, so it is easy to see and view.\n\n* You don't need a perfect credit score. If you're a hard-working person, we can look beyond your credit score.\n\n* If you don't have all the money for a security deposit, that's fine too. We can work something out, and it can be paid over time.\n\n* I love pets and don't charge pet rent. However, there is a one-time pet cleaning fee. Additionally, I'm fanatical about cleaning up after your pet. If you leave your dog's droppings without picking them up, you will incur numerous fines. If you're not comfortable picking up after your dog, this isn't the place for you.\n\n* Each month, all units in all our properties are sprayed for bugs each month.  There is no charge for this.\n\n* As I mentioned, you do not need to pay an application fee. Many property management companies treat application fees as a profit center and will charge you even if they know the place is rented or you won't qualify. This is not my approach, as I'm more interested in finding the right person than making an extra $1,000. If you decide you want it, I’ll ask you to pay the $35 credit report fee.\n\n* Past evictions are okay, with compensating factors.\n\n* If you prefer to meet in person, no problem.  We say this becuase many people read this and think it's a scam.\n\n* If something breaks, you are going to call us to get it fixed, you aren't going to get the run around by some big company.\n\n* The listed rent is the base rent. An administrative fee and a water/trash fee will be added to the monthly payments. This is standard practice for all apartment communities in Phoenix.\n\n* If this property doesn’t work for you, here is a website for other units I have for rent.\n\n* We offer on-site storage rental, so you don't need to rent a storage unit off-site. If we don't have one available, we can build one for you.\n\n* You can bring your own washer and dryer, or rent ours for $40-$60 per month (for both), depending on the type.\n\nThank you and I look forward to meeting you!\n\nPhilip, Lacey and Jersey with John Paul II Holding Company\n\n* If you would like to see our other properties:\n0:00 / 2:59\nBeautiful 1-Bedroom For Rent - NO APPLICATION FEE\nContact us, while we still have units available.\nSend message",
